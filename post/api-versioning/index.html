    <section class="text-break post-blog mx-auto">
      <p>The plugin API system is one of the central pieces of technology in <em>The Machinery</em>. Plugins can
use it to call APIs defined in the engine, call APIs from other external plugins, or expose APIs of
their own. The Machinery is essentially just a collection of plugins collaborating through these
interfaces.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Iâve written about the plug-in system before:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=" ../../post/little-machines-working-together-part-1/">Little Machines Working Together (Part 1)</a></li>
<li><a href=" ../../post/little-machines-working-together-part-2/">Little Machines Working Together (Part 2)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Today, I want to focus on a new feature that Iâve been working on for the 2021.9 release: API
versioning.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Versioning is needed for plugins to deal with changes to other plugins. For example, suppose the
engine has this API (APIs in The Machinery are structs with function pointers):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_engine_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>(<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>allocate)(uint64_t size);
};
</code></pre></div><p>and you use that in your plugin:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;tm_engine_api&#34;</span>);

thing_t <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>p <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> tm_engine_api<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>allocate(<span style="color:#66d9ef">sizeof</span>(thing_t));
</code></pre></div><p>You compile your plugin to a DLL that gets used by thousands of happy users. Then, one day, we
decide to change <em>our</em> API to add tags to allocations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_engine_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>(<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>allocate)(uint64_t size, <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tag);
};
</code></pre></div><p>Users who use your DLL with our new engine version will now have the <code>allocate()</code> function called
with the wrong number of parameters. This wonât result in any helpful error message, because
thereâs no runtime check that a function is called with the right number and type of parameters
â all those checks happen at compile time. Instead, the function will just try to get the
parameters from the stack, get some garbage values back and most likely crash horribly.</p>
<p>You can fix this by compiling a new version of the DLL, fixing all the <code>Not enough parameters for function allocate()</code> compile errors you get and then try to get that new DLL out to the users as
soon as possible.</p>
<p>But itâs kind of annoying that the crashes even happen in the first place. Itâs also annoying
that you have to tell the users to use the right version of the DLL with the right version of the
engine or everything will crash.</p>
<p>And there might be many reasons why you <em>canât</em> just compile a new version of your DLL at the
drop of a hat. Maybe you have other stuff to do? Maybe you have moved on to greener pastures? Maybe
your DLL depends on some other DLL and you have to wait for <em>that</em> DLL to upgrade first.
For users, trying to puzzle together a working application from DLLs of different versions can
quickly become a nightmare (known as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency
hell</a>).</p>
<p>This is not a great situation. What we would like instead would be something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As far as possible, the engine should be <em>backward compatible</em> with older DLLs. I.e., a DLL
compiled for an older version of the engine should continue to run on the new version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we canât do that, we should at least fail gracefully instead of bringing the whole editor down.
This would mean showing an error message, saying something like â<em>plugin XXX was compiled for an
older version of the engineâ</em> and then disabling the plugin before it can do any damage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can solve this, we can continue to evolve the engine rapidly without constantly breaking
everybodyâs projects.</p>
<h2 id="backward-compatibility">Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>To preserve backward compatibility, we must make sure that whatever changes we make to an API does
not cause any problems for a plugin that was compiled against an older version of that API.</p>
<p>We could achieve this by not changing the API at all, but thatâs not very interesting. We <em>want</em>
to change the API, to add new features, fix bugs, and adapt the code to new use cases. Being
flexible and easy to change is the most important property of code. Code that canât change is
doomed to die.</p>
<p>So letâs look at what changes we <em>can</em> make.</p>
<p>For binary compatibility between different versions of DLLs and executables, what matters is not
the API (the definitions in the header file), but the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a> (the Application Binary
Interface) â the binary layout of structs and function parameters. As long as the changes we make
to the <em>API</em> do not change the <em>ABI</em>, everything is good.</p>
<p>This can be a bit tricky if you are not used to thinking and reasoning about the <em>ABI</em>, so letâs
look at some examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_my_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>f)(uint32_t x);
};

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_my_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>f)(uint32_t y);
};
</code></pre></div><p>Old code calling v1 of this API will still work with v2. It doesnât matter that we changed the
name of the parameter because the name isnât a part of the ABI. In compiled code, we donât
reason about the names of function parameters, only about how they are passed (in registers or on
the stack). Even though the names differ, code using v1 will put the parameter in the place where
v2 expects to find it.</p>
<p>In fact, the name of the parameter doesnât even appear anywhere in the compiled code (itâs
saved in the PDB though, so the debugger can use it).</p>
<p>The same is true for fields in structs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    uint32_t people;
    uint32_t cats;
};

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_my_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>f)(<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla bla);
};

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    uint32_t number_of_people;
    uint32_t number_of_cats;
};

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_my_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>f)(<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla bla);
};
</code></pre></div><p><code>tm_my_api (v1)</code> and <code>tm_my_api (v2)</code> are still binary compatible. In the ABI, the struct fields
have no names, just byte offsets. The caller puts the number of people at a certain byte offset in
the struct and the callee looks for the number of people at that same offset. It doesnât matter what
the struct fields are called.</p>
<p>Renaming the function pointers in the API struct is safe too. They are just fields in the API
structs, so the same thing applies to them. As long as the same function is found at the same
offset in the API struct, it doesnât matter what itâs called.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This is true for function pointers in a struct, but itâs not true for exported functions. If
you export a function from a DLL with <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code>, the name of the function gets saved
in the DLL so that it can be retrieved by <code>GetProcAddress()</code> or <code>dlsym()</code>, but since the plugin
system in The Machinery is based around API structs with function pointers rather than exported
symbols, I wonât dwell on this further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Letâs look at a change that <em>would</em> cause problems:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    uint32_t cats;
    uint32_t people;
};
</code></pre></div><p>Here we have switched the order of the fields in the struct. The first four bytes of the struct
data, at offset 0, are now interpreted as the number of <em>cats</em> while the next four bytes, at offset
4, are interpreted as the number of <em>people</em>. A caller that was compiled for v1 of the API would
put the people count in the first 4 bytes and the cats in the last 4 bytes. If that caller was used
with v2 of the API, the callee would see the value that the caller put in the <code>people</code> field in the
<code>cats</code> field and vice versa. Effectively, we have <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U">transformed people into
cats</a>.</p>
<p>Letâs recap quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe: Changing the name of struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
<li>Unsafe: Changing the order of struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
<li>Unsafe: Changing the types of struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
<li>Unsafe: Adding or removing struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another safe thing we can do is make use of unused bits and bytes in the struct, as long as we know
they have been zeroed. For example, suppose we have:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>name;

    <span style="color:#75715e">// Must be zero
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    uint32_t reserved;
};
</code></pre></div><p>We can now do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>name;
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">float</span> height;
};
</code></pre></div><p>Hey now, this doesnât look very safe. We changed the type of the <code>reserved</code> field from <code>uint32_t</code>
to <code>float</code> and didnât I just say that we canât change the types of fields?</p>
<p>But in this case, it actually works. Both <code>unit32_t</code> and <code>float</code> have the same size and alignment,
so they end up at the same position in the struct. The only allowed value for <code>reserved</code> in v1 is
0, which is represented in memory as four zero bytes: <code>0 0 0 0</code>.</p>
<p>So if v2 gets called from v1, it will find four zero bytes in the <code>height</code> field: <code>0 0 0 0</code>. But
these four bytes are also a valid value for a <code>float</code>. In fact, they represent the floating-point
zero: <code>0.0f</code>. (Making sure that setting all the bytes of a data structure to 0 results in a good
default value is a good idea generally.)</p>
<p>So as long as the code in v2 has been written to handle the case where <code>0.0f</code> is passed in the
<code>height</code> field (which it should be since the whole goal here is to maintain backward
compatibility), everything will work out fine.</p>
<p>If you expect that you will need more data in a <code>struct</code> in the future, you can pad it with
<code>reserved</code> fields so you have somewhere to put that data when the time comes. You can find lots of
examples of this in the Microsoft APIs, for example, the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-win32_find_dataa">WIN32_FIND_DATA</a>
structure has two reserved fields called <code>dwReserved0</code> and <code>dwReserved1</code>.</p>
<p>Personally, Iâm not a huge fan of this approach. First, I find it aesthetically displeasing.
Second, anticipating future needs is really hard. How do you know which structs are going to need
more fields in the future and which arenât? How many bytes of reserved data should you put in? 4?
8? 128? Third, this has the danger of running into <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrumâs Law</a>.</p>
<p>Hyrumâs Law says that if your API has enough users, it doesnât matter what your documentation
says. Any observable behavior of your code will be <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://xkcd.com/1172/">depended on by
somebody</a>.</p>
<p>You <em>said</em> the <code>reserved</code> field <em>had</em> to be zero, right? But did you actually check it? And did you
<em>crash</em> if it wasnât zero? Because if you didnât, you know some user will have called it with
garbage data instead of zero:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">// Bla is created on the stack, contains random data.
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla bla;

<span style="color:#75715e">// bla.name is set to a reasonable value, but bla.reserved
</span><span style="color:#75715e">// is still uninitialized.
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>bla.name <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Niklas&#34;</span>;

tm_my_api<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>f(bla);
</code></pre></div><p>This works fine in v1 of the API since we didnât really use the <code>reserved</code> field for anything.
But in v2, this passes random data in the <code>height</code> field which will likely lead to unexpected
behavior.</p>
<p>How you look at this situation depends on how you feel about backward compatibility. You could say
that any developer who passed random data in the <code>reserved</code> field was using the API wrongly and
doesnât deserve backward compatibility in the first place. Itâs their fault if the code crashes
in a future version and you take no responsibility for it. We can call that the Apple approach.</p>
<p>Or, you can say that you value backward compatibility above everything else. Since some apps have
been passing garbage data in the <code>reserved</code> field and you donât want to crash those apps you can
now never use the <code>reserved</code> field for anything. It will just have to sit there unused in your API
for all eternity. We can call that the Microsoft approach.</p>
<p>Another âprepare for the future approachâ that you can see in Microsoft APIs is to have a size
field specifying the size of the struct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#75715e">// Must be set to sizeof(struct bla).
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    uint32_t size;
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>name;
};

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_my_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>f)(<span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>bla);
};

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#75715e">// Must be set to sizeof(struct bla).
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    uint32_t size;
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">char</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>name;
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">float</span> height;
};

<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_my_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v2
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>f)(<span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> bla <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>bla);
};
</code></pre></div><p>Here, the first field of <code>bla</code> specifies the size of the struct. When <code>f()</code> receives a struct, it
can check this value to figure out if a <code>struct bla (v1)</code> or a <code>struct bla (v2)</code> was passed and act
accordingly. Note that for this to work, we must pass the struct as a <em>pointer</em> to <code>f()</code>, because
if we passed it by value, the stack layout would depend on the size of the struct.</p>
<p>You can see the use of a <code>dwSize</code> field for this purpose all over the Microsoft APIs, for example
in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/ns-tlhelp32-processentry32">PROCESSENTRY32</a>.</p>
<p>Thereâs nothing magic about using the size of the struct for this purpose. You could use anything
that makes it possible to identify specific versions of the struct. For example, you could have an
explicit version number. But using the size is kind of convenient since it changes automatically as
you add new stuff and you donât have to figure out what version number to use. You can just type
<code>sizeof(struct bla)</code> and you will always get the right value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you forgot to put in a version number and realize you need one later, you might be able
to reuse some bits for that purpose. Find a bit that a v1 caller would never set (for example, the
highest bit of a size field) and set that to <code>1</code> to mean v2 or later and then of course add a
version number, so you donât have to resort to tricks like that again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Iâm personally not a huge fan of the <code>dwSize</code> field approach that Microsoft uses. I can
see the value when you want to maintain backward compatibility at all costs, but I find it ugly to
have <code>.dwsize = sizeof(BLA)</code> all over the code.</p>
<p>A final observation about this. The <code>dwSize</code> field is needed when you want to <em>pass</em> a struct
pointer into an API function. However, if the API <em>returns</em> a struct pointer, you can actually do
without it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> foo { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1

};
</code></pre></div><p>Consider here what happens if the v1 code runs against the v2 interface. We will get back a pointer
to a block of memory containing a v2 struct. The first bytes of that block are identical to the v1
struct. After that, we have some extra data (the <code>height</code> field), but the v1 code doesnât know
about this data and wonât care if itâs there or not.</p>
<p>Since the APIs in our plugin system are structs returned by pointers, the same is true for them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_my_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1

</code></pre></div><p>Code that is written for this v1 API will work just fine with the v2 API. It will find all the v1
functions at the expected position in the <code>struct tm_my_api * (v2)</code> and doesnât care that there
are additional functions at the end of it. So we can add new functions to an API without breaking
backward compatibility, which is really nice.</p>
<p>In fact, our APIs also have a certain amount of <em>forward compatibility</em>. When we register an API,
we copy the API struct to a memory block that has some extra space initialized to zero. This means
that if code that has been compiled for v2 runs against the v1 ABI, <code>tm_my_api_v2-&gt;g</code> is guaranteed
to be <code>NULL</code>. The code can check for this to determine if itâs running against the v1 or v2
version of the ABI.</p>
<p>Letâs summarize all we have learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe: Changing the name of struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
<li>Unsafe: Changing the order of struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
<li>Unsafe: Changing the types of struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
<li>Unsafe: Adding or removing struct fields and/or function parameters.</li>
<li>Safe: Repurposing unused bits and bytes in structs, as long as they are zero-initialized.</li>
<li>Safe: Changing the layout of structs passed as pointers, as long as we have a way of distinguishing different versions of the struct (e.g. a <code>size</code> field).</li>
<li>Safe: Adding fields at the end of structs returned as pointers.</li>
<li>Safe: Adding functions at the end of API structs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breaking-backward-compatibility">Breaking backward compatibility</h2>
<p>As we saw above, itâs possible to modify an API without breaking backward compatibility, but it
comes at a cost. We must be careful about what changes we make. Over time, the API will tend to
acquire more and more âcruftâ â stuff thatâs just there to provide backward compatibility
for older users.</p>
<p>So thereâs a tradeoff to be made here. We can either prioritize stability or we can prioritize
rapid development and being able to easily change and refactor the code. Thereâs no right answer.
Down one path lies the trap of stagnation and obsolescence, down the other you run the risk of
annoying your users with constantly breaking changes.</p>
<p>The tradeoff might change during the lifetime of the API too. In the beginning, when the API is new
and doesnât have many users, it might be more important to focus on development speed and being
able to fix any design mistakes. Later, when the API has matured and has more users, stability is
more important. It also depends on whether the API is internal â i.e., mostly used by your own
code â or external and affecting other users.</p>
<p>We want an approach that supports both these modes of development.</p>
<p>My initial plan was to not have version numbers for APIs in The Machinery, but instead do something
like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>While APIs are âunder developmentâ or âunstableâ â we change them at will and do not promise anything about backward compatibility.</li>
<li>When a particular API becomes âlockedâ or âstableâ â we maintain backward compatibility by only adding new functions at the end of the API struct.</li>
<li>If we need to break backward compatibility of a stable API â we do it by introducing a completely new API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Say weâre working on the <code>tm_ui_api</code> for example. We could add new functionality to it by adding
functions at the end of the API. If we needed to change the parameters of a function, we could do
so by deprecating the old function and adding a new one at the end of the API:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_ui_api { <span style="color:#75715e">// v1

};
</code></pre></div><p>Note that this change is backward compatible. Weâre not changing the parameters of the original
<code>set_active()</code> function, just its name, which is ok. And weâre adding the new <code>set_active()</code> at
the end of the API struct which is also OK. Also, note that weâve complicated the API with some
cruft â an extra function for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>If we for some reason need to make a breaking change (hopefully thatâs rare) we can do it by
introducing a whole new API:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_ui_api {

</code></pre></div><p>For a time, the application can continue to expose both <code>tm_ui_api</code> and <code>tm_ui_api_v2</code> until
<code>tm_ui_api</code> is deprecated and all clients are switched over to <code>tm_ui_api_v2</code>.</p>
<p>I still think this is a pretty decent plan. It maximizes backward compatibility and clients donât
have to deal with versioning (which is an extra burden). So whatâs the problem?</p>
<p>The main issue is the âunstableâ APIs. We kind of need them, because when we add a new API, we
donât want to promise stability from day one. We want to be able to experiment and explore the
design space. This is especially true since a lot of users are working directly against our master
branch and see every little change we make to the engine, not just fixed release points.</p>
<p>This means that if anyone uses one of these unstable APIs and we make a change to it, their plugin
will just crash and bring down the whole editor. Thatâs not really a tenable situation.
We could tell people to just <em>not</em> use any of the âunstableâ APIs or we could wait with
publishing them until theyâre âdoneâ. But thatâs not a great approach either. We believe in
iterative workflows, pushing early and often. We want the development of the engine to move fast,
and we want to encourage people to experiment with it. Itâs very valuable to have real users try
out an API at an early stage to get feedback on it.</p>
<h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
<p>So looks like weâre going to need versioning of APIs. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>We assign a version number to each API.</li>
<li>Any time the API changes, we update the version number.</li>
<li>When you request an API, you specify which version of the API you want.</li>
<li>If you request a version thatâs not available, an error message will be printed and your plugin will be disabled. The same happens if the API doesnât exist at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have some additional requirements too. We want the system to be easy to use in the most common
case (get the latest version), but support more advanced use cases when we need them. It should
also support both forward and backward compatibility.</p>
<p>For version numbers, weâll use the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210923033545/https://semver.org/">semver</a> standard. Semver version numbers
consist of three numbers: <em>major</em>, <em>minor</em>, and <em>patch</em> (e.g. 10.2.3):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_version_t {
    uint32_t major;
    uint32_t minor;
    uint32_t patch;
};
</code></pre></div><p>The server standard also specifies how these numbers should be updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a breaking change to the API, you should increase the <em>major</em> version number (and set <em>minor</em> and <em>patch</em> to 0).</li>
<li>If you add new functionality to the API in a backward compatible way, you should increase the <em>minor</em> version number (and set <em>patch</em> to 0). In our case, this usually happens when we add new functions at the end of the API.</li>
<li>If you fix bugs in the implementation without changing the API, you should increase the patch version.</li>
<li>When the <em>major</em> version is 0, the API is considered <em>unstable</em>. In this case, nothing is promised about backward compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>For basic versioning support, we will just add version numbers to the functions that query for and
register APIs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">tm_ui_api <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get(TM_UI_API_NAME, (tm_version_t){<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>});

reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>set(TM_UI_API_NAME, (tm_version_t){<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>}, tm_ui_api, <span style="color:#66d9ef">sizeof</span>(<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tm_ui_api));
</code></pre></div><p>Many systems that work with version numbers allow for more complex queries. For example, you may
ask for <code>&gt;2.0.0</code> (any version greater than 2.0.0) or <code>3.1.*</code> â requiring major version 3 and
minor version 1, but any patch number.</p>
<p>However, for our purposes, I donât think such queries are necessary. Whatâs special about our
system is that it uses <em>binary versions shipped in an executable</em> whereas many other versioning
systems are created to work with <em>source code modules stored on a server.</em></p>
<p>With source code modules, using a different major version than the one you requested might very
well work â as long as you are not calling any of the functions that changed. And if you do, you
will get an error message when you compile the final executable. In contrast, with binary versions,
a major version mismatch will almost guarantee a crash, with no way of fixing it (unless you are
the developer of the crashing plugin). So we really want the major version to match exactly what
the user asked for.</p>
<p>When it comes to minor and patch versions, since APIs with the same major version are backward
compatible, there is really no point for a plugin/executable to export multiple APIs with the same
major version (e.g. 2.1.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, etc). The plugin/executable can just export the latest one
(2.2.2) and clients that ask for an earlier version (2.1.0) can just use that since itâs backward
compatible.</p>
<p>If a client asks for a later minor version of the same major version (e.g. 2.3.0), I think the
right thing to do is to fail the request. 2.3.0 may have some additional API functions that are not
there in 2.2.0, and if the client asks for 2.3.0, we must assume that they might call those
functions, which would crash on 2.2.0. So we fail the request with a message that 2.3.0 is not
available.</p>
<p>What about the patch version? What should we do if the client asks for 2.2.2, but we only have
2.2.1. My mind is a bit split on this one. On the one hand, the client might depend on a bug fix
that was done in 2.2.2 and crash under 2.2.1. On the other, maybe itâs better to run with the
2.2.1 than to not be able to run the client at all. For now, Iâve decided to fulfill the request
in this case.</p>
<p>Since <em>unstable</em> APIs (major version 0) donât promise anything about backward compatibility, a
request for an unstable API will only succeed if the version matches exactly.</p>
<p>If a plugin fails to obtain an API that it depends on we want to disable that plugin. Letâs see
how this can work in practice:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">load</span>(tm_api_registry_api <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>reg, <span style="color:#66d9ef">bool</span> load)

}
</code></pre></div><p>You might think that disabling the plugin could be implemented like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> tm_other_api)
    reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>set(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;my_api&#34;</span>, (tm_version_t){<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>}, <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span>my_api, <span style="color:#66d9ef">sizeof</span>(my_api));
</code></pre></div><p>But in The Machinery <code>tm_engine_api</code> will always be non-NULL, because we allow the <code>get()</code> and
<code>set()</code> calls to resolve in any order â i.e., <code>set()</code> can be called <em>after</em> <code>get()</code>.</p>
<p>When <code>get()</code> is called we return a pointer to a pre-sized internal buffer filled with NULL values.
Then later, when <code>set()</code> is called, for the same API and version, that buffer gets populated with
the actual API struct through a <code>memcpy()</code>.</p>
<p>So we canât really check if <code>get()</code> was successful or not until we have loaded all the plugins
(and know all the <code>set()</code> calls that were made).</p>
<p>To do that, we can simply record all the <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code> calls made by a plugin in the load
phase. When loading has completed, we go through all the <code>get()</code> calls that we recorded and check
if we were able to find matching APIs. If any of the <code>get()</code> calls failed, we print an error
message and disable the plugin. âDisablingâ in this case, means just going through all the
<code>set()</code> calls that we recorded and undoing them â effectively removing the APIs from the
registry. In the example above, if the plugin was not able to retrieve <code>tm_other_api</code>, <code>my_api</code> API
will be removed.</p>
<p>Note that this can cause a cascading effect where one plugin gets disabled because itâs missing a
dependency, which in turn causes other plugins to be disabled because they depended on <em>that</em>
plugin, etc.</p>
<p>This is what it might look like when we get a cascade of dependency failures:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">Disabling tm_application_api in libthe<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>machinery<span style="color:#f92672">-</span>dll.dylib (tm_dxc_shader_compiler_api <span style="color:#ae81ff">1.0.0</span>)

</code></pre></div><p><code>tm_application_api</code> was disabled because it couldnât get the <code>tm_dxc_shader_compiler_api</code>. The
<code>tm_draw2d_api</code> in turn was disabled because it depends on the <code>tm_application_api</code> and then the
Pong Tab plugin was disabled because it uses the <code>tm_draw2d_api</code>.</p>
<p>To help diagnose dependency problems, I made a quick helper tool that can print the dependencies of
a plugin in GraphViz format. For example, here are the current dependencies of the <code>tm_entity_api</code>:</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Dependencies of tm_entity_api." src="../../images/apiver__dependencies.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Dependencies of tm_entity_api.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>If you are not careful, you can easily end up in situations where your API depends on <em>everything</em>,
because it depends on something, that depends on something, that depends on something else.</p>
<p>To help break those dependency chains we have the concept of an <em>optional</em> dependency. An optional
dependency means that your plugin will use the API if itâs there, but the plugin will still run
even if itâs not:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get_optional(<span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span>tm_other_api_opt, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;tm_other_api&#34;</span>, (tm_version_t){<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>});
</code></pre></div><p>Unlike <code>get()</code>, <code>get_optional()</code> doesnât return the API pointer, instead, we pass in a <em>pointer</em>
to the API pointer. This lets the API registry patch the pointer in the <code>set()</code> and <code>remove()</code>
calls. So we can determine if the optional API has been loaded with a simple test of the pointer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (tm_other_api_opt)
    tm_other_api_opt<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>foo();
</code></pre></div><h2 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h2>
<p>Being able to <code>set()</code> and <code>get()</code> specific versions of an API and handling errors is really all we
need for the versioning system to work. But I also wanted to do something to improve the
<em>ergonomics</em> of using this functionality.</p>
<p>When Iâm talking about ergonomics of code I mean things that donât really change the
functionality but make the code easier to use and steers the user in the right direction. Letâs
look again at our basic call for accessing an API. In context, it will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">static</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tm_engine_api;

<span style="color:#75715e">// ...
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;tm_engine_api&#34;</span>, (tm_version_t){<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>});
</code></pre></div><p>There are multiple things that can go wrong here.</p>
<ol>
<li>The user may request the wrong version of the API. While there are legitimate use cases for
requesting a specific, older version of the API (and weâll talk more about that later), the
typical case is that you want to compile your code against the current version of the API. If the
user types in a manual version number thereâs a chance they type the wrong thing. It can also be
a bit of a chore to keep updating the version number (although you could argue that itâs good to
make a conscious choice about what version you are depending on).</li>
<li>The user may misspell the name of the API in the request. For example, a request for
<code>tm_egine_api</code> will fail.</li>
<li>Since C doesnât have generics, the <code>get()</code> call returns a <code>void *</code>. The user must assign this
to an API pointer of the right type. This is another possibility for mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these issues are super serious. Itâs fairly easy to make mistakes, but the issues will be
pretty obvious â the API will fail to load or you will get a crash as soon as you try to call
something. Still, I think it can be useful to help the users a little bit. As programmers, we are
constantly dealing with mental overload. Anything we can do to improve that situation is worth it.</p>
<p>For the first issue, we can simply define a macro that holds the current version number:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#define tm_engine_api_version TM_VERSION(2, 1, 0)
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now the call becomes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;tm_engine_api&#34;</span>, tm_engine_api_version);
</code></pre></div><p>We could do the same thing for <code>âtm_engine_apiâ</code> and introduce a define <code>tm_engine_api_name</code>.
But since we want the name to <em>always</em> be the same as the name of the API, we can use the
preprocessorâs ability to stringify symbols instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#define tm_get_api(reg, TYPE) reg-&gt;get(#TYPE, TYPE##_version)
</span></code></pre></div><p>Which can be used like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> tm_get_api(reg, tm_engine_api);
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>#</code> macro operator turns <code>tm_engine_api</code> into the string <code>&quot;tm_engine_api&quot;</code> while <code>##</code>
concatenates the symbols <code>tm_engine_api</code> and <code>_version</code> into <code>tm_engine_api_version</code>. So the
preprocessor expands this into the same text as we earlier wrote by hand.
We can use this same macro to provide type safety too:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#define tm_get_api(reg, TYPE) (TYPE *)reg-&gt;get(#TYPE, TYPE##_version)
</span></code></pre></div><p>When expanded, this will cast the <code>void *</code> returned by <code>get()</code> into a <code>tm_engine_api *</code> . If the
type of the <code>tm_engine_api</code> variable doesnât match, an error will be generated.
We have a similar macro for setting an API:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#define tm_set_or_remove_api(reg, load, TYPE, ptr)                           \
</span><span style="color:#75715e">    do {                                                                     \
</span><span style="color:#75715e">        if (load) {                                                          \
</span><span style="color:#75715e">            struct TYPE *typed_ptr = ptr;                                    \
</span><span style="color:#75715e">            reg-&gt;set(#TYPE, TYPE##_version, typed_ptr, sizeof(struct TYPE)); \
</span><span style="color:#75715e">        } else                                                               \
</span><span style="color:#75715e">            reg-&gt;remove(ptr);                                                \
</span><span style="color:#75715e">    } while (0)
</span></code></pre></div><p>Here we assign <code>ptr</code> to a local variable <code>typed_ptr</code> to ensure type safety. We also use <code>#</code> and
<code>##</code> to generate the API name and version number as before. Finally, we use the same macro to both
<em>set</em> the API (when <em>load</em> is <em>true</em>) and <em>remove</em> the API (when <em>load</em> is <em>false</em>). This lets us
run the same code snippet for load and unload of the API, ensuring that the <code>set()</code> and <code>remove()</code>
calls match up.</p>
<p>Iâm a bit of two minds when it comes to the use of preprocessor macros like this. Iâm not a
huge fan of macros that expand to huge globs of stuff. It makes it hard to read the code and figure
out whatâs going on. On the other hand, macros are the <em>only</em> way to get something akin to
type-safe generics in C, so we kind of need them. And for things like this, a few well-chosen
macros can reduce the amount of code we need by a lot and change things that would have been
runtime errors into compile errors, which is always good.</p>
<h2 id="forward-and-backward-compatibility">Forward and backward compatibility</h2>
<p>Letâs see how this solution works for forward and backward compatibility. Weâll assume that we
have a plugin API <code>my_plugin_api</code> that has been compiled against an engine API <code>tm_engine_api</code> of
version 2.1.0.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with a new minor version</strong></p>
<p>A new version of the engine is released. In this version <code>tm_engine_api</code> has version 2.2.0.
The compiled plugin will request 2.1.0 of the API. According to our rules, the 2.2.0 version that
the engine has is compatible, so the engine will return it. Since 2.2.0 is backward compatible, the
plugin will be able to call it the same way as it called 2.1.0 and everything will work
automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with an old minor version</strong></p>
<p>In this case, someone takes our plugin â that was compiled for version 2.1.0 â and tries to run
it with an engine that just has 2.0.0.</p>
<p>What happens here depends on what our plugin is doing. If our plugin is requesting the latest
version of <code>tm_engine_api</code> with a call such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> tm_get_api(reg, tm_engine_api);
</code></pre></div><p>The version weâre requesting will be locked to the value that <code>tm_engine_api_version</code> has when we
compile our plugin, i.e. 2.1.0. This means that the call will fail with the older engine version.
The plugin is requesting 2.1.0 and the engine only has 2.0.0 available and according to our rules,
2.0.0 cannot be returned for a request for 2.1.0.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure that your plugin is compatible with older engine versions, you have to
make sure to explicitly request the API from that version, even if a newer version is available.
The easiest way of doing that is by using a header from that older version of the engine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&#34;engine_api_200.h&#34;</span><span style="color:#75715e">
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> tm_get_api(reg, tm_engine_api);
</code></pre></div><p>By including the older header rather than the current one, you get the <code>tm_engine_api_version</code> that
was used in that header (2.0.0). You also make sure that you donât accidentally use any
functionality that was added in 2.1.0 (which would be easy to do if you included the latest
header). This is important because using those functions would crash when run against 2.0.0.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with a new major version</strong></p>
<p>Suppose a new version of the engine is released and in this engine, the API has version 3.0.0. Your
plugin wonât work with this API, because 3.0.0 is not backward compatible with 2.1.0.
Your only hope in this situation is that the developers of the API decided to provide backward
compatibility with the 2.1.0 version. They could do that by publishing <em>both</em> a 2.1.0 and a 3.0.0
version of the API. But itâs up to them and what they want to prioritize. If their main focus is
on developing new features, they may decide to just ship a 3.0.0 version and force everybody to
recompile their plugins to work with the new version. If they are willing to put in the extra work
to support backward compatibility they may export both 2.x.x and 3.x.x versions.</p>
<p>Similarly, you, as a developer of <code>tm_my_api</code> may decide if you want to ship multiple versions of
the API or not.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with an old major version</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that in addition to running on an engine that has the 2.0.0 API, you want your plugin to
also work with engines that have the 1.0.0 API. You can achieve this by requesting both 1.0.0 and
2.0.0 and use whichever one is available.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_engine_api_100 <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tm_engine_api_100;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_engine_api <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tm_engine_api;

reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get_optional(<span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span>tm_engine_api_100, TM_STRINGIFY(tm_engine_api),
    (tm_version_t){<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>,<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>});

reg<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get_optional(<span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span>tm_engine_api, TM_STRINGIFY(tm_engine_api),
    tm_engine_api_version);
</code></pre></div><p>Note the use of <code>get_optional()</code> instead of <code>get()</code> here. We donât want our plugin to fail if
1.0.0 is not available, since weâre fine with using 2.0.0. Similarly, we donât want to fail if
2.0.0 is not available either, since we can do with 1.0.0.</p>
<p>Also note that in this case, we need a separate type <code>struct tm_engine_api_100</code> to represent the
layout of the API struct as it looked in version 1.0.0.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I feel pretty happy with the way the version system came out. Though it adds a bit of complexity,
by using the helper macros, users that just want to compile with the latest version can pretty much
ignore the versioning system and still get the benefit of getting explicit errors if there is a
version mismatch. At the same time, users who want to dig deep and make sure they are compatible
with multiple versions can do so.</p>
