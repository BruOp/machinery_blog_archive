      <p>In this post, I will discuss how we went about adding support for <em>Subgraphs</em> to our graph editor
and <em>Graph Interpreters</em>. Weâll look at what <em>Subgraphs</em> are, why we need them, how we added them,
how <em>Subgraphs</em> may be promoted to <em>Function Graphs</em>, and what room for improvement we currently
see.</p>

  </figure>
<h2 id="whats-a-subgraph-what-are-they-good-for">Whatâs a Subgraph? What are they good for?</h2>
<p>A <em>Subgraph</em> is a graph contained within another graph. Analogous to code, you may think of a graph
as a function that in turn calls another function: the <em>Subgraph</em>. We tend to denote the graph that
calls the Subgraph as the <em>Parent Graph</em>. Many game engines and content authoring tools support
Subgraphs, but there are lots of variations. Some just use Subgraphs as a simple grouping mechanism,
in which a set of nodes can be collapsed into a single <em>Subgraph Node</em>. Others support Subgraphs
through a full-on <em>Function</em> <em>Graph</em> concept, in which any piece of a graph may be exported as a
<em>reusable</em> function. Common to both these approaches is that there exists a graph node, the
<em>Subgraph Node</em>, that either contains a Subgraph or references a Function Graph.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two main reasons for supporting Subgraphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Grouping.</strong> Graphs tend to become messy monsters, and grouping pieces of it using Subgraphs is
one way to create order. One other way of creating order I have been thinking about is adding
support for creating colored, named background regions, but thatâs for another time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-usability.</strong> Any Subgraph concept is a good stepping stone towards support for Function
Graphs. Our goal was to first add support for Subgraphs where the actual Subgraph is contained
within the Subgraph Node â i.e. the contained Subgraph can only be shared with copy-paste and
modifications do not propagate between copy-pasted copies â and then, once we got that working,
make it possible to export the Subgraph to a reusable <em>Asset</em>, which gives us something analogous
to Function Graphs. Splitting work up into manageable chunks like this makes it more fun, since
you see results more readily, and you <a href=" ../../post/moving-away-from-git-flow/">donât have to sit on a big branch for too
long</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inputs-and-outputs">Inputs and Outputs</h2>
<p>A Subgraph doesnât do much unless it defines a set of <em>Inputs</em> and <em>Outputs</em>. We decided to add the
definition of these Inputs and Outputs to all our graphs instead of having a separate type for
Subgraphs. Here are all the properties that a graph object has in <a href=" ../../post/the-story-behind-the-truth-designing-a-data-model/">The
Truth</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> {

</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>};
</code></pre></div><p>You can see the nodes, connections, data, and comments, which were all there before â the new thing is the <em>Interface</em>. It is represented by a separate Truth type, with these properties:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> {

</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    TM_TT_PROP__GRAPH_INTERFACE__OUTPUTS, <span style="color:#75715e">// subobject_set(GRAPH_OUTPUT)
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>};
</code></pre></div><p>Each Input is an object with these properties (Outputs have the same properties):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> {
    TM_TT_PROP__GRAPH_INPUT__DISPLAY_NAME <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>, <span style="color:#75715e">// string
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    TM_TT_PROP__GRAPH_INPUT__ID, <span style="color:#75715e">// string
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    TM_TT_PROP__GRAPH_INPUT__TYPE_HASH, <span style="color:#75715e">// uint64_t
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>};
</code></pre></div><p>The <em>Display Name</em> is for representing these Inputs and Outputs in the UI. The <em>ID</em> is a unique
identifier, so we can be sure to which Input or Output a connection goes. The <em>Type Hash</em> is the
hash of the type name that the Input or Output expects.</p>
<p>Thereâs a good reason for adding this Interface directly to the graph instead of to some object
specific for Subgraphs: Down the road, this approach will make it very easy to promote a Subgraph to
an Asset (a Function Graph), but weâll get back to that near the end of this post.</p>
<p>We also need two new graph node types: the <em>Input Node</em> and the <em>Output Node</em>. Below is a tiny
example graph below with these two nodes present. These two nodes are used <em>within</em> the Subgraph, to
make it possible to connect stuff to the Inputs and Outputs defined in the Interface.</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="A simple subgraph with an Input Node and an Output node." src="../../images/subgraph__simple_subgraph.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>A simple subgraph with an Input Node and an Output node.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The Input Node and Output Node dynamically create their connectors based on the set of Inputs and
Outputs defined in the Interface of the graph they belong to. When designing this, we had to choose
between having a separate node for each Input or coalescing all Inputs in a single Input Node. We
chose to go with the latter, but for the convenience of the user, it is possible to spawn multiple
Input nodes.</p>
<p>In the image above, you may have noticed the <strong>+</strong> at the bottom of the Input and Output Nodes. When
connecting to it, it looks at the other end of the connection and uses that name and type to create
a new Input or Output. This is currently the main way to add new Inputs and Outputs. In addition,
there is a panel where you can rename and delete them. This is another reason for displaying all
Inputs or Outputs instead of having separate nodes for each; with separate nodes, it would make no
sense to have a <strong>+</strong> connector.</p>

        <h4>Adding a new Vector3 Input to to a Subgraph.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<h2 id="the-subgraph-node-a-node-with-a-graph-inside">The Subgraph Node: A Node with a Graph Inside</h2>
<p>The third, and final, new node type required is the <em>Subgraph Node</em>. We have an optional generic
data blob associated with all nodes. In the case of the Subgraph Node, this data blob contains a
graph object; the Subgraph.</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="A Subgraph Node with connectors generated from the Interfaceâs Inputs &amp; Outputs." src="../../images/subgraph__node.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>A Subgraph Node with connectors generated from the Interfaceâs Inputs &amp; Outputs.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The Subgraph Node looks at the Interface of the graph it contains and, similarly to the Input and
Output nodes, dynamically creates connectors for all the Inputs and Outputs. It also has the handy
<strong>+</strong> connector for creating new Inputs and Outputs. Double-clicking the Subgraph Node opens the
Subgraph it contains,  switching current graph view to view that graph.</p>
<h2 id="actually-creating-subgraphs">Actually creating Subgraphs</h2>
<p>Now that we have all the nodes required we should ask ourselves: How do we actually create the
Subgraph? One way is to just create a Subgraph Node and open the empty Subgraph (double-click the
node) and add stuff to it. But the user probably wants something more powerful, such as selecting a
bunch of nodes and turning those into a Subgraph. Here we could re-use the code we already had for
copying nodes between graphs: copy-paste.</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Selecting a bunch of nodes and turning them into a subgraph." src="../../images/subgraph__selecting_nodes.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Selecting a bunch of nodes and turning them into a subgraph.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>In the image above I have selected a bunch of nodes. Selecting Create Subgraph will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a Subgraph Node at the center of the area that the selected nodes occupy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>âCut &amp; Pasteâ all selected nodes and all connections between the selected nodes to the Subgraph
contained inside the new Subgraph Node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the dangling connections â i.e. those connections that have one node <em>in</em> and one node
<em>outside</em> the selection â to figure out sensible Inputs and Outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace all dangling connections: In the Parent Graph, we replace them with connections to the Subgraph Node. In the Subgraph, we spawn Input Nodes and Output Nodes and replace the dangling connections with connections to those nodes. See the two images below.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interpreting-it">Interpreting it</h2>
<p>The Machinery has one <em>Interpreter</em> for each of the two graph types in the engine: The <em>Entity
Graph</em> and the <em>Creation Graph</em>. The Entity Graph is for gameplay scripting, while the Creation
Graph is for managing resources in the CPU-GPU borderland. Tobias has blogged about the Creation
Graph <a href=" ../../post/creation-graphs/">here</a> and
<a href=" ../../post/more-on-creation-graphs/">here</a>. Itâs the Interpreterâs job to
actually <em>run the graph</em>: Each node type has code associated with it that takes some inputs, does
some computations, and sends out the result to any nodes down the line. At first, adding Subgraphs
into this mix sounded a bit hard. The Interpreter does a lot of pre-calculations based on the nodes
and connections, and only after that runs the actual node-specific code. Throwing another graph into
the middle of the interpretation processes was begging for trouble, so we settled for a simpler
approach: <em>Flattening the graph.</em></p>
<p>What this means is that instead of recursively handling Subgraphs during interpretation, we do a
pre-pass where all the Subgraphs are expanded. The first thing the Graph Interpreter does is that it
imports the graphs from The Truth into some acceleration structs, using the <code>tm_graph_importer_api</code>.
This API used to have only a single function: <code>import</code>, but now it has two:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_graph_importer_api
{
    tm_graph_import_result_t (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>import_shallow)(<span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_the_truth_o <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tt, uint64_t graph_id, <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_graph_node_type_i <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>types, uint32_t num_types, <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_temp_allocator_i <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>ta);
    tm_graph_import_result_t (<span style="color:#f92672">*</span>import_flattened)(<span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_the_truth_o <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>tt, uint64_t graph_id, <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_graph_node_type_i <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>types, uint32_t num_types, <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_temp_allocator_i <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>ta);
};
</code></pre></div><p><code>import_shallow</code> does not expand Subgraphs, it does exactly what the importer did before: It goes
through the Truth object of the graph and creates acceleration structures for performantly reasoning
about the graph. This is the function that the graph editor uses since it just wants to show the
Subgraph Node, but not itâs contents, with the possibility of double-clicking it, opening the
contained Subgraph.</p>
<p><code>import_flattened</code> adds a pre-pass to the import process. Internally, it starts off by calling a
function named <code>flatten_graph</code>, which adds all the nodes, connections, etc to lists, except for
Subgraph Nodes, Input Nodes, and Output Nodes. If it stumbles upon a Subgraph Node it will instead
recursively call <code>flatten_graph</code>, which will continue to add all nodes, connections, etc to the same
lists. Whenever it finds an Input Node or Output Node inside a Subgraph, it will ignore the node.
But it wonât ignore the connections to it, it will patch them to the matching connections on the
Parent Graphâs Subgraph Node. When this is done it continues the import in the same manner as
<code>import_shallow</code>.</p>
<p>The two Graph Interpreters now use <code>import_flattened</code>. Switching them to use this function is the
only change I needed to do inside the Graph Interpreter when adding support for Subgraphs â the
Interpreters have no clue what Subgraph is.</p>
<h2 id="function-graphs-reusable-graph-assets">Function Graphs: Reusable graph assets</h2>
<p>I promised early on that our strategy should allow us to easily move from only supporting Subgraphs
(the Subgraph is contained inside the Subgraph Node and can only be used once) to Function Graphs.
Function Graphs are reusable Subgraphs that have been promoted to an <em>Asset</em> instead of living
inside the node.</p>
<p>In The Machinery, an <em>Asset</em> is a thing that can be displayed by the <em>Asset Browser</em>. Each Asset has
these properties in The Truth:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> {
    TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__NAME <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>, <span style="color:#75715e">// string
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__DIRECTORY, <span style="color:#75715e">// reference(ASSET_DIRECTORY)
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__OBJECT, <span style="color:#75715e">// subobject(*)
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>};
</code></pre></div><p><em>Name</em> is the filename to be displayed in the Asset Browser. <em>Directory</em> is a reference to a Truth
object representing a directory. <em>Object</em> is the actual thing that the Asset contains, it can be of
any type. The Object also dictates the file extension to be displayed after the filename, by the use
of a <em>File Extension Aspect,</em> essentially a piece of data that may be associated with any The Truth
type. If the Object implements the File Extension Aspect, then that aspect will tell the Asset
Browser which extension the Asset should have.</p>
<p>Back to the problem at hand: Function Graphs. In the image below we see a Subgraph Node (named
<em>Check Direction</em>, you can name the Subgraph Nodes using the label field available on all nodes).
Weâve added a context menu item to it called <em>Create Subgraph Prototype.</em> When chosen, it will clone
the Subgraph contained inside the Subgraph Node and then wrap it inside one of those Assets
described above. This is done by creating a new Asset object in The Truth and setting the Object
property to the Subgraph just cloned. The Name of the Asset is taken from the label of the Subgraph
Node. The Directory is set to be  the one currently viewed in the Asset Browser. The new Asset is
then added to the Asset Browser so that it shows up properly.</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Creating a Subgraph Prototype Asset." src="../../images/subgraph__create_asset.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Creating a Subgraph Prototype Asset.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The new Asset is shown below, it has the extension <em>entity_graph</em> because this Subgraph came from an
Entity Graph. A Subgraph Prototype from the Creation Graph would have the extension
<em>creation_graph,</em> as dictated by the File Extension Aspect **on the Assetâs Object.</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="The new Graph Prototype Asset." src="../../images/subgraph__asset.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>The new Graph Prototype Asset.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The only thing that remains is to make the Subgraph Node somehow use this Asset. We do this using
our prototyping system. We <em>create an Instance</em> of the Object contained inside the Asset and assign
it as the Subgraph Nodeâs Subgraph. Double-clicking the Subgraph Node will now open this Instance.
Any changes to the Asset will be reflected in the Instance, but the user may also create overrides
inside the Instance, changing, moving, or removing any node or connection.</p>
<p>We now have functionality equal to that of Function Graphs, the user can create additional Subgraph
Nodes that use the same Asset as Prototype. This is done using the Prototype picker that is visible
while the node is selected, as shown in the gif below. Choosing a Prototype in this picker will
replace the nodeâs current Subgraph with an Instance of that Prototype.</p>

  </figure>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h2>
<p>I am quite pleased with how all this turned out, but there are some issues that I would like to
address at some point:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is currently only possible to add Inputs and Outputs using the <strong>+</strong> connector. There exists
disabled code for manually adding them, but we currently have no good way of figuring out which
types to make available to the user â i.e. we have no central point where we store a list of
âblessed typesâ that may be used within a graph, the nodeâs themselves may use any type on their
connectors. One idea I had as I was writing this sentence is to iterate over all the registered
node types, look at all the connectors and assemble a list of those types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Creation Graph currently has itâs own concept of inputs and outputs, used for parameterization
of the Creation Graphs and making it possible for one Creation Graph to reference another. There
are some striking similarities to the stuff I built for Subgraphs, such as input nodes, etc. But
there are some differences. We are still on the fence about combining these two concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be nice to have a way to quickly spawn Subgraph Nodes with a prototype already set,
avoiding a two-step. We could do this by enumerating all Assets that contain a graph, and show
those in the node-spawning menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flattening of the graph that we do for the interpreter is a simple approach. But it has two
problems, the first is that it does not support recursion, allowing it would cause a stack
overflow while expanding the graphs. The second is performance. We may want to add some âcachingâ
of the graphs down the line, making sure that any graph only has to be imported from The Truth
once. It may even store the result of the compiled graph â although that would require us to
reason about what values the Inputs had during compilation, as this affects the result. Both these
