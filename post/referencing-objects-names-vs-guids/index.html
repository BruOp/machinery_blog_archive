    <section class="text-break post-blog mx-auto">
      <p>One question that I keep coming back to again and again is whether references
between objects are best represented as <em>names</em> or
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220330202033/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier"><em>GUIDs</em></a>.</p>
<p>Here is the situation: You have created some sort of <a href=" ../../post/the-story-behind-the-truth-designing-a-data-model/">data
model</a>
for representing objects in memory/on disk. Now you need the ability for objects
to refer to other objects. I.e., an object needs to talk <em>about</em> another object.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A material object may point to a texture object and say âI want to use this as
my diffuse mapâ.</li>
<li>An animation object may point to a model object and say âI want to rotate this
model around its z-axisâ.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can we accomplish this?</p>
<p>Here are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Names:</strong> Each object is referred to by its <em>name.</em> The name is a string
assigned to the object by the user and the user can change this string at will
(rename the object).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GUIDs:</strong> Each object is referred to by a globally unique identifier (GUID).
The GUID is assigned to the object on creation and never changes. It is
guaranteed to only represent this particular object and no other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Names are resolved in some kind of context (typically the children of the
current object). Thus, to refer to an object that is âfar awayâ from us we might
have to use a sequence of names to navigate the object tree, e.g.,
<code>../../player/head/left_eye</code>. Much like a path in a file system, this sequence
of names provides a <em>path</em> from one object in our object tree to another. Note
that in this post I will sometimes somewhat sloppily talk about the <em>name</em> of an
object when I actually mean the full path to an object.</p>
<p>You might protest that there are other ways of representing references too. For
example, an in-memory representation could just use a pointer. A disk
representation could use a file offset. Combinations are possible too â for
example (filename + offset) to represent an object inside a file. However, it is
easy to become confused when considering the myriad of possibilities, so letâs
put all of that aside for the moment. In this post, Iâm going to focus on the
difference between <em>names</em> and <em>GUIDs</em> and in the end we will see how the
discussion applies to the other possibilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note: There is another interesting option apart from names and GUIDs and
that is to refer to an object by the hash of its content. With this approach,
the same content is always referred to by the same unique identifier (its
hash) and if you change the content all the references have to be updated. If
you start to think about it, most of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220330202033/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>
falls out as the result of this single design decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Names and GUIDs both have their pros and cons, making it hard to say that one is
strictly better than the other:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Names</strong></th>
<th><strong>IDs</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fragile â if objects are renamed, moved or deleted, references will break</td>
<td>Unreadable â references look like random numbers which makes them hard to debug</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cumbersome â coming up with meaningful names for everything is a chore</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Expensive â names have to be matched against the object tree to find the objects</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of these points can be argued back-and-forth endlessly. Canât we
auto-assign names to make them easier to come up with? But how readable are
names really if most of the things are just named <code>box_723</code>? Canât we make a
tool that looks up a readable name from a GUID? Canât we also make a tool that
automatically patches references when an object is renamed? Etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Again, itâs easy to get stuck in the nitty-gritty details of this and miss the
bigger picture. To make things clearer, letâs take a step back and ask
ourselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the fundamental difference between names and GUIDs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about it for a bit. Hereâs my answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A GUID specifies an object identity, but a name specifies an objectâs role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GUID <code>90e2294e-9daf-45f0-b75b-01fb85bb6dc8</code> always refers to one specific
object â the one single object in the universe with that GUID. The path
<code>head/left_eye</code> refers to whatever object is currently acting as the characterâs
left eye. It does not always have to be the same object. Maybe the character
loses her eye at some point and it gets replaced with a glass eye. Maybe we can
spawn multiple instances of the character in different configurations with
different kinds of eyes â flesh eyes, robot eyes, anime eyes, etc. Regardless of
the setup, <code>head/left_eye</code> will refer to the characterâs left eye.</p>
<p>In contrast, if we used a GUID to refer to the left eye and the eye got
replaced, the GUID would still refer to the old eye we lost. And a single GUID
couldnât be used to refer to different eyes in different character setups.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Name</strong></th>
<th><strong>GUID</strong></th>
<th><strong>Hash</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>References objects by</strong></td>
<td>Their role</td>
<td>Their identity</td>
<td>Their content</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The pointers and offsets that I talked about in the beginning of the post are
similar to GUIDs, since they reference objects by identity. A pointer always
points to the same object. In fact, you could see a pointer as a deserialized
version of a GUID â a way of uniquely referencing an object in memory. Offsets
too, uniquely identify objects. (But offsets are not permanent, so references
must be updated each time a file is saved.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A name allows for âlate bindingâ of references.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get from a name to an actual object, we need to <em>resolve</em> the name at some
point. This involves matching the path against the object tree and finding the
corresponding object. In contrast to a GUID, which always points to the same
object, a name might resolve to different things at different points in time, or
in different contexts. The reference isnât bound to a particular target until
the name is resolved.</p>
<p>When does this happen? You can decide that when you design a system based on
your performance/flexibility requirements. For example, you can decide to
resolve all references once and only once â when the object is spawned. This is
faster, because you only need to look references up once, but it also means that
in the case where the eye is removed and replaced, the reference wonât be
updated to point to the new eye. So itâs less flexible.</p>
<p>The other option is to resolve the reference every single frame. This can handle
objects being removed and/or replaced, but it also means having to pay the
performance cost of resolving the reference every single frame.</p>
<p>With this new understanding of the fundamental difference between names and
GUIDs we can take another look at the pros and cons we listed above and see if
we can understand them better.</p>
<p><strong>Names are fragile â they can break if objects are moved, renamed or deleted</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this is the whole point!</p>
<p>The main reason for using names is to allow late binding. Late binding means we
donât know beforehand what the name will resolve to (or if it will resolve to
anything at all). We canât get the benefits of late binding without also getting
the drawbacks.</p>
<p>For instance, in the example above, after the eye has been removed, but before
it has been replaced with a glass eye, <code>head/left_eye</code>  will not resolve to
anything â because the character doesnât have a left eye. Code that expects to
find an object at <code>head/left_eye</code> might break.</p>
<p>A name might also resolve to <em>something unexpected</em>. For example, the eye might
be removed and replaced by a little man. Code that was written to deal with an
eye, or even with no eye, might break when it finds a little man in the eye
socket.</p>
<p>In addition to breaking in this correct way â where a resolve rightly fails
because the object doesnât exist â references can also break in incorrect ways.
The resolve might fail, not because there is no eye, but because the user made a
mistake. For example, maybe the eye was named <code>LeftEye</code> instead of <code>left_eye</code>.</p>
<p>To an extent â problems like this can be mitigated by good tooling. For example,
the tools might warn about unresolved references. The tools might also assist
with renaming, so that if you rename <code>left_eye</code> â <code>LeftEye</code> all the references
are updated to <code>LeftEye</code> too.</p>
<p>But note that there is an inherent conflict here. The whole point of using names
is to allow the references to be more lax and flexible. If the tools are too
anal with their warnings it kind of defeats that purpose. For example, it might
be totally correct that <code>head/halo</code> doesnât refer to anything, because the
character starts out without a halo â she only gets that once sheâs completed
the Holy Mission. If a tool spews out false positive warnings about things like
this, users will soon learn to ignore them and miss the actually valuable
warnings about real typos.</p>
<p>Similarly, tools canât be too aggressive about updating references when objects
are renamed either. Suppose that you designed a really cool robotic left eye for
the character. Then you decide that it would look better as the right eye, so
you move it into the right eye socket and rename it from <code>left_eye</code> to
<code>right_eye</code>. If the references are auto-patched, all references to the left eye
will now be changed to the right eye, which probably isnât correct. For example,
if the <code>left_eyebrow</code> had a reference to its eye, and that reference was
auto-patched, the <code>left_eyebrow</code> would now think it sits over the <code>right_eye</code>.
On the other hand, some references could have meant âthe robotic eyeâ rather
than âthe eye in the left socketâ when they talked about <code>left_eye</code> and those
references <em>should</em> get patched. Pretty messy and hard to make a nice UI for,
although <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220330202033/https://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2010/10/dependency-checker.html">Iâve tried
before</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Names are cumbersome â coming up with meaningful names for everything is a chore</strong></p>
<p>As discussed above, a <em>name</em> isnât just a string of characters, it is a
description of a role, of a relationship.  <code>head/left_eye</code> means the left eye
object in the head of the character. If you gave it a nonsensical name like
<code>bob</code> or an auto-generated name like <code>Object_13</code> it wouldnât say anything about
the role.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the late binding feature of names you want to use
meaningful names that match the concepts that you have in your game. I.e. if
your characters can put on different helmets and backpacks you probably need
<code>helmet</code> and <code>backpack</code> names. If helmets and backpacks are just visual features
of some character models, canât be removed or swapped out and donât have any
gameplay purpose, they might not need their own names, they might just be part
of the <code>head</code> and <code>body</code>.</p>
<p>You can think of this naming as sort of a âlogical riggingâ of the model.</p>
<p>So yes, if you want to take advantage of late binding, you do have to spend some
time coming up with meaningful names and hierarchies. If all your objects are
just named <code>entity_2713</code> you are basically just using names as IDs. This has all
the drawbacks of names (fragility, costly resolution) as well as all the
drawbacks of IDs (unreadability). Donât do that.</p>
<p><strong>Names are expensive â they have to be resolved</strong></p>
<p>Again, late resolve is the point of using names, and it will always have a cost.
You canât get the benefit of late resolve without paying the cost for it.</p>
<p>Of course, it can be more or less costly, depending on how you implement it. My
most important performance tip is: be clear about the scope in which names are
resolved.</p>
<p>I like to use fully qualified paths. I.e., referring to a characterâs left eye
would be <code>head/left_eye</code>. Referring to the left eye from the right eye would be
<code>../left_eye</code>. Here,  <code>..</code> goes up to the head and then <code>left_eye</code> descends to
the right eye.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to fall into the trap of convenience and say that we should
be able to just use the name <code>left_eye</code> to refer to the left eye instead of a
full path, but it has scary performance implications. Instead of just searching
our children for a name match, we now have to search all our descendants
recursively. And if we want this to work from the right eye too, we not only
have to search all <em>our</em> descendants, we have to search all our <em>parentâs
descendants</em> too. Before you know it, you have to search the entire world for
this <code>left_eye</code>. And even if we find it, how do we know it is the âright oneâ â
the one the user meant? Maybe our helmet has a little statue on it, and maybe
that statue has a <code>left_eye</code> too? How do we make sure we donât find that one?
Messy.</p>
<p>My preferred implementation for resolving paths is to first hash each part of
the path (this can be done offline), and then at each step, we match the hash at
that step against the hashed names of the current objectâs children â either
through a lookup table or directly. Maintaining a lookup table is probably only
worth it once you start to have hundreds of children to match against.</p>
<p>Even though this avoids really expensive stuff like searching the entire object
tree or doing string comparison, it is still a lot more expensive than just
following a pointer (which an ID deserializes into).</p>
<h2 id="names-vs-guids--the-smackdown">Names vs GUIDs â The Smackdown</h2>
<p>With this deepened understanding â who wins, names or GUIDs?</p>
<p>As discussed above, names have many disadvantages â theyâre fragile, cumbersome
and costly. But they have two main advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They express intent. When I refer to <code>head/left_eye</code> it is clear to the reader
what I <em>want</em> to refer to. Thus names have a <em>meaning</em> that pointers/GUIDs
donât have. Recording this meaning can be helpful. When we complain that
identifiers are <em>unreadable</em>, it is the lack of <em>meaning</em> we talk about â not
just the fact that the identifier is a jumble of hex characters. But meaning
requires explicit intent. If your object is named <code>entity_23415</code> â there is no
meaning in the name, it might just as well be called
<code>cc1b9a7b-a5bb-4355-8cf1-f78b74fe2774</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They allow for âlate bindingâ of the reference to an actual object. This
allows new objects to âtake the placeâ/âfill the roleâ of the originally
referred object. Using this, we can âpatchâ objects in lots of interesting
way. For example, we can take a character, replace its eye with something else
and all references to the eye will still work. To do this with GUIDs we need
to patch up all references too, so that they point to the ânew eyeâ.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So which is best? It comes down to a judgment call.</p>
<p>My take is this â weâre trying to create a high-performance user-friendly game
engine. Thus, we only want to pay the costs of using names (bad performance &amp;
fragility) in the cases where we really take advantage of their strengths
(intent &amp; late binding). In my experience â most of the times, we <em>donât need</em>
these features. For example, when you are placing a bunch of trees in a level
you donât really care about naming them and you donât have any need for
something else âassumingâ the role of one of those trees.</p>
<p>For this reason, <em>The Machinery</em> uses GUIDs as the default way to represent
references. When a model refers to a texture, it does so with a GUID. You can
move or rename the texture and the model will still keep using the same texture
until you explicitly point it to a different one.</p>
<p>But in addition to this, we also explicitly allow for <em>name</em> references in some
systems â systems that we think benefit from the extra flexibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our visual scripting system has a âlookup entity by nameâ node, allowing
entities to be referred to semantically (such as <code>head/left_eye</code>) from within
the scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our animation system is still under construction, but we plan to have a
similar feature there, allowing animations to target loose and flexible things
such as <code>helmet/headlight/color</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Having two different âkindsâ of references like this is in the engine by no
means ideal. Whenever we are designing a system we have to ask ourselves: does
this reference need the flexibility offered by names or is using a GUID OK? We
are also possibly missing out on some flexibility  â in the cases where weâve
decided to use a GUID, it is much more cumbersome for the user to achieve the
kind of dynamic retargeting that names make easy.</p>
<p>Still, it seems like the best compromise to me â we get the performance and
stability of GUIDs/pointers in the majority of the code, but can still use the
flexibility of names in the situations where we think itâs needed.</p>

format uses names for everything. From their viewpoint, having to occasionally
fix broken references is worth the extra flexibility they get from using names
everywhere. Of course, since theyâre not primarily targeting real-time
rendering, their performance requirements are different.</p>

before</a>, if you
want to see how my viewpoint has shifted over the years. Note though that the
focus of that article is a little bit different. In that article Iâm talking
about referencing assets/resources on disk, so when I mention a <em>path</em> in that
article I mean a <em>disk path</em>. Whereas, in this post, Iâm talking more about
references in general and Iâm not that concerned with exactly how things get
serialized to disk.</p>
