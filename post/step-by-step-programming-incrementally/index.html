    <section class="text-break post-blog mx-auto">
      <p>One thing that has really benefited my productivity (and also my general sanity), has been learning
how to take a big task and break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Big tasks can be
frightening and overwhelming, but if I just keep working on the list of smaller tasks, then somehow,
as if by magic, the big task gets completed.</p>
<h2 id="adding-value">Adding value</h2>
<p>When programming, I take a very specific approach to this breakdown. I make sure that each step is
something that <em>compiles, runs, passes</em> all the tests*,* and *adds value* to the codebase*.* Exactly
what âadds valueâ means is purposefully left vague, but it can be things like adding a small
feature, fixing a bug, or taking a step towards refactoring the code into better shape (i.e.,
reducing <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220512072646/https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikqYmb_6DsAhXSpZ4KHYm9BhgQFjAHegQIBxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTechnical_debt&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ZJ1dsWoB5Jn1hXvtLGuSZ">technical
debt</a>).</p>
<p>An example of <em>not</em> adding value is adding a new feature, but also introducing ten new bugs. Itâs
not clear that the value of the feature outweighs the cost of the bugs, so it might be a net loss.</p>
<p>Another example of not adding value is making the UI prettier, but also make the app run ten times
slower. Again, itâs not clear that the prettier look is worth the performance hit, so it might be a
net loss.</p>
<p>Of course, I canât always be sure that Iâm not introducing bugs, and âvalueâ is inherently
subjective (how much performance is a new feature worth). The important part is the <em>intention</em>. My
<em>intention</em> is to always add value with every single commit.</p>
<p>Basically, what I want to avoid is the âIt has to get worse before it gets betterâ-attitude. Also
known as: âThe new system is the modern way to do it. Sure, it has some bugs and runs kind of slow
right now, but once weâve fixed that, itâs going to be way better than what we had before.â Iâve
seen too many cases where these supposed fixes never happen and the new system, which was supposed
to be better, just made things worse.</p>
<p>Plus, you know, it feels good to add value. If every day I can make a commit and that commit makes
the engine better in some way, that makes me happy.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-to-master">Pushing to master</h2>
<p>In addition to implementing changes through a series of small commits, I also <em>push every one of
those small commits back to the master branch.</em></p>
<p>Note that this is the exact opposite of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220512072646/https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">feature
branch</a> workflow, instead, it is a form of
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220512072646/https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development">trunk-based</a>
development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a feature branch workflow developers work on new features in isolated, separate branches of the
code and donât merge them back to master until theyâre âcompleteâ: fully working, debugged,
documented, code reviewed, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the trunk-based approach, features are implemented as a series of small individual commits to
the master branch itself. Care must be taken so that everything works even when the features are
only âpartially implementedâ:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Trunk-based vs feature branch development." src="../../images/step__trunk-based-development.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Trunk-based vs feature branch development.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>Proponents of the feature branch approach claim that it is a safer way to work since changes to the
feature branch donât disrupt the master and cause bugs. Personally, I think this safety is illusory.
Bugs in the feature branch just get hidden until itâs merged back to master when we suddenly get
<em>all</em> the bugs.</p>
<p>Feature branches also go against my philosophy that every commit should add value. The whole idea
behind a feature branch is: âweâre going to break a bunch of shit over here, but donât worry, weâll
fix it before we merge back to masterâ. Better not to break stuff in the first place.</p>
<p>Here are some other advantages I see with the trunk-based approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fewer merge conflicts.</strong> With long-running feature branches, the code in the branch drifts
further and further away from the code in master, causing more and more merge conflicts. Dealing
with these is a lot of busy work for programmers and it also risks introducing bugs. Some of these
bugs wonât be seen until the branch is merged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Less release-day chaos.</strong> Typically, all features scheduled for a certain release have the same
deadline. This leads to all feature branches being merged just before the deadline. This means
that we get all the merge and integration bugs at the same time, just before the release date.
Getting a lot of bugs at the same time is a lot worse than having them spread out evenly. And
getting them just before a release is due is the absolute worst time to get them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No worry about the right time to merge.</strong> Since everybody knows that merging a feature branch
tends to cause instability, this leads to worry about the âright timeâ to merge. You want to avoid
merging right before a release (unless the feature is required for the release) to avoid
introducing bugs in the release. So maybe just after the release has been made? But what if we
need a hotfix for the release? While the merge is being held, valuable programmer time is being
wasted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No rush to merge.</strong> When working with feature branches, I often felt a hurriedness about getting
the branches merged. Sometimes because a branch was needed for a specific release. But also often
because the developer was tired of dealing with merge conflicts, wanted to get it over with, and
move on to the next thing. Thus, the goal of only merging feature branches when they are
âcompleteâ was often compromised. (And of course, nothing is ever really âcompleteâ.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easier to revert.</strong> If major issues are discovered after the merge of a feature branch (which
often happens), there is often a lot of reluctance to revert the merge. Another big feature branch
might already have been merged on top of it (since lots of feature branches often get merged at
the same time, just before a release), and reverting it would cause total merge chaos. So instead
of doing a calm, sensible rollback, the team has to scramble desperately to fix the issues before
the release. With trunk-based development, any major issues would most likely have already been
discovered. The final commit that makes the new feature âgo liveâ is typically a simple one-line
change that is painless to revert.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partial work is shared.</strong> In trunk-based development, the partial work done on a feature is seen
by all developers (in the master branch). Thus, everybody has a good idea of where the engine is
going. Bugs, design flaws, and other issues can be discovered early. And it is easier for others
to adapt their code to work with the new feature. Itâs also easier to get an estimate of how much
work is needed to complete a feature when everybody can see how far it has progressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easier to pause and pick up later.</strong> Sometimes, work on a feature might have to be paused for a
variety of reasons. There might be more critical issues that need to be addressed. Or the main
developer of the feature might get sick, or have vacation coming up. This is a problem for feature
branches because they tend to ârotâ over time, as the code base drifts further and further away,
causing more and more merge conflicts with the branch. Code that is checked into master does not
ârotâ in the same way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easier to address other bugs/refactors at the same time.</strong> When working on a feature or a
problem, it is pretty common to find other, related problems, exposed by the work you are doing.
In the trunk-based approach, this is not an issue. You would just make one or more separate
commits to the trunk to fix those issues. With the feature branch approach, it is more tricky. I
guess the <em>right</em> thing to do would be to branch off a new separate bug fix branch from master,
fix the issue in that branch, merge <em>that</em> branch into the branch you are currently working on,
and (once it passes code review) into master (so that other people get the bug fix before your
feature branch is merged, because who knows when that will happen). But who has time for all that
shit? So instead, people just fix the problem in their feature branch, and maybe cherry-pick it
into master if theyâre having a good day. So now, instead of being about a single isolated
feature, the feature branch becomes a tangled mix of different features, bug fixes, and refactors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main challenge of the trunk-based approach is how to break a big task down into individual
pieces. Especially, with the requirement that each piece should compile, run, add value, and be
ready to be pushed into master. How can we push partial work without exposing users to half-baked,
not yet fully working features?</p>
<p>Letâs look at some problems and how to solve them.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-new-features">Problem #1: New features</h2>
<p>An approach that works well for new features is to use a flag to control whether a feature is
visible to end-users or not.</p>
<p>Letâs look at an example. A feature that I recently added to the engine was a <em>Download</em> tab that
lets the users download new engine versions and sample projects from within the engine itself:</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Download tab." src="../../images/step__download-tab.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Download tab.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>There are lots of different ways this could be broken down into smaller steps. Hereâs an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the <em>Download</em> tab to the menus and show a new blank tab when itâs opened.</li>
<li>Show a (hard-coded) list of things to download (without working download buttons).</li>
<li>Download the list of files from a server instead of having it hard-coded.</li>
<li>Implement the <code>[Get]</code> button by synchronously downloading the file when itâs clicked.</li>
<li>Switch to asynchronous, background downloading.</li>
<li>Show a progress bar for the download.</li>
<li>â¦</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, I donât do a full breakdown like this upfront. Instead, I just kind of figure out the next
logical step as I go along. I only sit down and do a serious planning session if the task is
particularly tricky and incremental steps like this donât come naturally.</p>
<p>To prevent end-users from seeing the tab before itâs actually working, I hide it behind a flag. This
can be as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">bool</span> download_tab_enabled <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> false;

<span style="color:#75715e">// ...
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (download_tab_enabled) {
    add_menu_item(tabs, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Download&#34;</span>, open_download_tab);
}
</code></pre></div><p>To get the menu option to show the <em>Download</em> tab, you have to change the <code>download_tab_enabled</code>
flag to <code>true</code> and recompile.</p>
<p>We call these flags <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220512072646/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle"><em>feature flags</em></a> since they
selectively enable or disable individual features of the application. Once the feature is complete,
we can remove the flag and just leave the <code>true</code> code path.</p>
<p>There are three main ways of implementing a feature flag:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Through a <code>#define</code> macro that is checked by <code>#ifdef</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through a <code>const bool</code> in the code (as in the example above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through a dynamic <code>bool</code>  variable that is initialized from a config file, a menu option or an
internal debug console.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these options, I think the third one is the best. You want to expose your new code to <em>as
many people as possible</em>. That way, they can find bugs in your code, if they refactor the codebase,
they take your code into account, etc.</p>
<p>If you use a <code>#define</code> flag, other people on your team wonât even compile your code. Thus, one of
their changes could easily end up breaking your code. A <code>const</code> flag is better, because your code
will still be compiled, but since people canât try the new feature without recompiling your code,
most people wonât bother.</p>
<p>With a dynamic flag, artists, producers, or end-users who donât want to be bothered with rebuilding
the application can just modify the config file and then give your new feature a test run.</p>
<p>When the time comes to release a feature, you simply flip the default value of the feature flag from
<code>false</code> to <code>true</code> and everybody will see the new feature. If there are issues and you need to
revert, you simply flip the flag back. Later, when the feature seems stable, you can get rid of the
flag and just keep the <em>true</em> path in the code.</p>
<p>You can even do a partial, staged rollout. E.g., you could set the flag to <em>true</em> for 1 % of the
users and then slowly ramp that up while monitoring the crash logs and the forums for any issues.
That way, if a problem is encountered, it will only affect a small number of users and you can
quickly revert.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2-rewrites">Problem #2: Rewrites</h2>
<p>The above approach works well for new features, but what should you do if you are doing a major
rewrite of an existing system?</p>
<p>In this case, it might be trickier to find an incremental step-by-step approach, because you might
want to rip out large parts of the old system and it will take a while until the replacement code
reaches feature parity.</p>
<p>It might be tempting to reach for the feature branch approach in this case, but again, I donât think
itâs the right strategy. A big problem is you will have two conflicting goals. On the one hand, you
want to merge early so that people see the improved code and you get some testing on the rewrites.
On the other hand, you want to delay it as long as possible, so that you can reach feature parity
and iron out all the bugs. What usually happens is an unsatisfying mix of the two.</p>
<p>A better approach is to make a parallel implementation and let the engine have two copies of the
same system.</p>
<p>If you are doing a major overhaul, you could start by just copying the entire system code to a new
folder. If you are rewriting from the ground up, you could start with an empty folder.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the system you are replacing, you could either have both systems (the old
and the new one) running in parallel, or you could have a feature flag that selects which of the
systems should be the default. For example, if you are rewriting the physics simulation, you
probably need a flag to select if you are using the old or the new one since you want all physics
objects to live in the same simulation (otherwise they wonât interact). On the other hand, if you
are rewriting the particle effect system, you could potentially have both systems running and just
select for each played effect whether it should play in the old or the new system.</p>
<p>Having parallel implementations lets you do a much smoother transition from the old to the new
system. Everyone on the team can easily test out the new system. You can compare it to the old one
for feature completeness, stability, performance, etc. If applicable, you could even run automated
tests to verify that the new system produces the exact same output as the old one. Once the new
system has been thoroughly verified, you can change the flag and start using it as the default.</p>
<p>The parallel implementations also provide a much gentler upgrade path for end-users. Instead of
tying everyone to the same âmerge dateâ, you can just expose the system selection flag to the
end-users. Users who are eager to try out the improved features in the new system can turn the flag
on early, while users who favor stability or depend on certain quirks in the old system can decide
to stay on it, even after the new one has become the default.</p>
<p>And there is no immediate rush to retire the old system once the new one has become the default, you
can eventually deprecate and phase it out once the burden of maintaining it outweighs the value of
having it around.</p>
<h2 id="problem-3-refactoring">Problem #3: Refactoring</h2>
<p>For our final problem, letâs consider something even trickier â making a big refactoring change to
the entire codebase. It could be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling a new warning such as <code>-Wshadow</code> or <code>-Wunused</code>.</li>
<li>Changing the parameters of a commonly used function.</li>
<li>Changing a commonly used type, such as switching from  <code>std::string</code> to an internal string type.</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge with refactors like this is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They tend to touch a lot of the code, increasing the risk of merge conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Itâs often tricky to see how to do them incrementally. For example, if you change the parameters
of a function, you must update all the call sites. Otherwise, the code simply wonât compile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, it can be pretty straightforward how to approach the problem incrementally. For
example, when we add a new warning such as <code>-Wshadow</code>, the fixes we do in order to make the code
compile <em>with</em> the warning do not cause any problems when compiling the code <em>without</em> the warning.
So we can simply turn on the warning, fix a bunch of the errors we get (however many makes a
suitably sized commit), turn the warning off again, and then commit the result. Rinse and repeat
until all the warnings are fixed and then do a final commit that turns the <code>-Wshadow</code> flag on for
everybody.</p>
<p>In other cases, we can employ the parallel implementation strategy. Suppose we have a function that
is used all over the code to allocate memory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">mem_alloc</span>(uint64_t bytes);
</code></pre></div><p>Now we want to add a <code>system</code> parameter so that all memory allocations can be tagged as belonging to a particular system (gameplay, graphics, sound, animation, etc):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">mem_alloc</span>(uint64_t bytes, <span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> system sys);
</code></pre></div><p>If we just added the parameter like this, the code wouldnât compile until we fixed <em>all</em> the call
sites. I.e., the incremental approach would not work.</p>
<p>What we can do instead is introduce a new parallel function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">mem_alloc</span>(uint64_t bytes);
<span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span><span style="color:#a6e22e">mem_alloc_new</span>(uint64_t bytes, <span style="color:#66d9ef">enum</span> system sys);
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can incrementally transition all of the code to use <code>mem_alloc_new()</code> instead of
<code>mem_alloc()</code>. Once we have transitioned all of the code, we can remove <code>mem_alloc()</code> and then do a
global search-and-replace that renames <code>mem_alloc_new()</code> â <code>mem_alloc()</code>.</p>
<p>The final challenge is the trickiest one of them all â changing one of the fundamental types in the
codebase.</p>
<p>In fact, I recently had a run-in with this, which is what prompted me to write this whole blog post.
In my case, I wanted to refactor our codebase to introduce a new type to represent the IDs of
objects in The Truth. <a href=" ../../post/the-story-behind-the-truth-designing-a-data-model/">The
Truth</a> is our main
data store in The Machinery. All the data that the editor works on is stored in The Truth, and every
object in The Truth is referenced by its ID.</p>
<p>We used to represent Truth IDs with just an <code>uint64_t</code>, but since we have lots of other values that
are also represented by <code>uint64_t</code>s this was causing increasing confusion. In order to provide
better documentation of where a Truth ID is expected and some type-safety against passing other
<code>uint64_t</code> values, we decided to switch from using a plain <code>uint64_t</code> to wrapping it in a struct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">typedef</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_tt_id_t {
    uint64_t u64;
} tm_id_tt_t;
</code></pre></div><p>Note that since Truth IDs are used <em>everywhere,</em> this change impacts thousands of lines in the code.</p>
<p>Somewhat arrogantly, I still set out to do this refactor as a single concentrated push. I <em>know</em> I
should do things incrementally, thatâs what this whole blog post is about, but sometimes I mess up.</p>
<p>As I worked on it, I realized this change was a lot bigger than I had originally thought and there
was no way I was going to be able to finish it in a single sitting. I started to get that sinking
feeling that things were spiraling out of control. I was changing <em>thousands</em> of lines of code. Was
I really sure that I wasnât introducing typos anywhere?</p>
<p>A lot of the changes were changing things like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">!</span>object_a) {
</code></pre></div><p>into:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (<span style="color:#f92672">!</span>object_a.u64) {
</code></pre></div><p>Was I really 100 % sure that I wasnât sometimes typing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> (object_a.u64) {
</code></pre></div><p>instead? Running some tests would have increased my confidence, but since the code wouldnât compile
until I had fixed <em>everything</em>, I couldnât run any tests.</p>
<p>Then I started to get merge conflicts with other peopleâs changes which I had to resolve by hand,
hoping that I understood their code well enough not to break anything. It became harder and harder
to picture the consequences of all the changes. How many bugs was I introducing?</p>
<p>In the past, Iâve often tried to deal with these âpanickyâ feelings by âpowering throughâ. Starting
to pull long late-night coding sessions to try to wrestle this thing that is slipping away from me
back under control. Get all my changes in before someone else has a chance to push anything so that
I donât have to deal with the merge conflicts. (Which of course just means that <em>they</em> have to deal
with the merge conflicts instead. Ha ha!)</p>
<p>But these days Iâm maybe a little bit wiser? I realize that these feelings are a sign that I have
bitten off more than I could chew and that the right response is not to push forward, but instead
take a step back, reflect and try to reformulate the problem so it can be approached in a series of
smaller steps instead. Depending on how much trouble Iâve gotten myself into, I might be able to
salvage some of the changes or I might just throw it all away and start over with an iterative
approach. Even when Iâve had to throw everything away, Iâve never regretted it. In the end, working
in a series of small, controlled steps is so much more productive that I feel like I always gained
back the time I âlostâ.</p>
<p>Back to the problem at hand. I knew I wanted to change the type <em>incrementally.</em> I.e., change it in
some files, but not in others, and still be able to compile and test the code. But how could I
possibly do that, when everything depends on everything else? Once I change some parameters to use
<code>tm_tt_id_t</code>, anything that calls it with <code>uint64_t</code> will produce an error.</p>
<p>My key insight was that this situation is very similar to the one of enabling <code>-Wshadow</code>. That
transition was easy to do because we changed the code from compiling just under <code>-Wno-shadow</code> so
that it compiles under <em>both</em> <code>-Wshadow</code> and <code>-Wno-shadow</code>. We can do this change incrementally
until weâre finally ready to turn on <code>-Wshadow</code>.</p>
<p>Letâs do the same thing here. Weâll call the type of the ID objects <code>ID_TYPE</code>. Right now, our code
compiles when <code>ID_TYPE</code> is <code>uint64_t</code>. Our goal is to rewrite that code so that it compiles <em>both</em>
when <code>ID_TYPE</code> is <code>uint64_t</code> and when it is <code>tm_tt_id_t</code>. If we can incrementally transition to that
state, then once all the code compiles when <code>ID_TYPE</code> is <code>tm_tt_id_t</code> we can make that the default.</p>
<p>Hereâs a simple example to show how this works:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">uint64_t <span style="color:#a6e22e">get_data</span>(uint64_t asset)
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> tm_the_truth_object_o <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>asset_r <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> tm_tt_read(tt, asset);
    uint64_t data <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> api<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get_subobject(tt, asset_r, TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__OBJECT);
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> data;
}
</code></pre></div><p>To make this independent of the value of <code>ID_TYPE</code>, we can rewrite it as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">ID_TYPE <span style="color:#a6e22e">get_data</span>(ID_TYPE asset)
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">const</span> tm_the_truth_object_o <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>asset_r <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> tm_tt_read(tt, asset);
    ID_TYPE data <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> api<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>get_subobject(tt, asset_r, TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__OBJECT);
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> data;
}
</code></pre></div><p>This works regardless of whether <code>ID_TYPE</code> is <code>uint64_t</code> or <code>tm_tt_id_t</code>. In our header file, we put
something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">typedef</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">struct</span> tm_tt_id_t {
    uint64_t u64;
} tm_tt_id_t;

<span style="color:#75715e">#define TM_NEW_ID_TYPE 0
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
<span style="color:#75715e">#if TM_NEW_ID_TYPE
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">typedef</span> tm_tt_id_t ID_TYPE;
<span style="color:#75715e">#else
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">typedef</span> uint64_t ID_TYPE;
<span style="color:#75715e">#endif
</span></code></pre></div><p>We can now commit and push our <code>get_data()</code> function without needing to change anything else in the
code. Everything will still compile because <code>ID_TYPE</code> is by default defined as <code>uint64_t</code>, so all
the places that call <code>get_data()</code> with an <code>uint64_t</code> will still work. Weâve taken a small,
incremental step towards switching out the ID type.</p>
<p>To take another step, just as we did with <code>-Wshadow</code>, we set <code>TM_NEW_ID_TYPE=1</code> locally. This will
produce thousands of errors, but we donât have to fix them all at once. We just fix a few (whatever
is a suitable commit chunk) by modifying the code just as we did with <code>get_data()</code>. Then we change
<code>TM_NEW_ID_TYPE</code> back to 0 and check that everything still compiles and runs OK. If it does, we can
commit <em>those</em> changes. Rinse and repeat until the whole codebase is fixed.</p>
<p>There might be some situations where just changing <code>uint64_t</code> to <code>ID_TYPE</code> doesnât work. For
example, there is some code in the codebase that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">bool</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">objects_equal</span>(uint64_t a, uint64_t b)
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> b;
}
</code></pre></div><p>Since we are writing strict C code, we canât implement <code>operator==</code> for <code>tm_tt_id_t</code>. We need to
compare the objects with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> a.u64 <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> b.u64;
</code></pre></div><p>(Side note: I often wish that == would work on C structs. The compiler should determine whether the
struct contains any padding bytes. If not, == should be implemented as <code>memcmp</code>, otherwise, as a
member-by-member comparison.)</p>
<p>Again, our goal is to replace the old code with new code that compiles for <em>both</em> possible values of
<code>ID_TYPE</code>. This means we canât just write <code>a.u64</code>, because that wonât compile when <code>a</code> is an
<code>uint64_t</code>. But we can make use of the preprocessor once again and write something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#if TM_NEW_ID_TYPE
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#75715e">#define TO_U64(x) ((x).u64)
</span><span style="color:#75715e">#else
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>    <span style="color:#75715e">#define TO_U64(x) (x)
</span><span style="color:#75715e">#endif
</span></code></pre></div><p>Here, the <code>TO_U64</code> macro will produce an <code>uint64_t</code> from an <code>ID_TYPE</code> object, regardless of whether
the <code>ID_TYPE</code> is wrapped or not. Now, we can rewrite the <code>objects_equal()</code> function as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">bool</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">objects_equal</span>(ID_TYPE a, ID_TYPE b)
{
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> TO_U64(a) <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> TO_U64(b);
}
</code></pre></div><p>And the code will compile with both the new ID type and the old one.</p>
<p>There are other ways of doing this too. For example, instead of <code>TO_U64(x)</code>, we could have created
an <code>ID_EQUAL(a,b)</code> macro.</p>
<p>The main point is that by making use of the preprocessor, it should be possible to take whatever
code we have and rewrite it in such a way that it compiles with both possible values for
<code>TM_NEW_ID_TYPE</code>. Once we can do that, we can incrementally transition more and more code to the new
type.</p>
<p>Once the whole code is converted we can disable the <code>TM_NEW_ID_TYPE=0</code> code path and then
(incrementally, if we so desire) remove all the transitional macros, <code>ID_TYPE</code>, <code>TO_U64</code>, etc by
replacing them with their <code>TM_NEW_ID_TYPE=1</code> values.</p>
<p>Using this approach, I was able to completely transition over from <code>uint64_t</code> to <code>tm_tt_id_t</code> with
10-15 incremental commits over a couple of days, while all the time compiling and testing to make
sure nothing was broken by the changes. Commits from other team members didnât cause many merge
issues, because my commits were all short-lived (an hour or so of work) and didnât touch that many
files. This big and scary change was suddenly very manageable.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I think the incremental pattern can be applied everywhere. It just requires a little bit of
ingenuity to reformulate the problem in an incremental way and this is something that you get better
at with practice.</p>
<p>Doing things incrementally has a bit more overhead. For example, we werenât able to change <code>object</code>
to <code>object.u64</code> in one go, we had to transition via <code>TO_U64(object)</code>. However, I think that extra
time is soon earned back. By working incrementally you can make calm, steady, confident progress
towards your goal, and in the end that allows you to work a lot faster. For example, with the ID
type change, I was able to make a lot of changes using global search-and-replace with regular
expressions. If I hadnât been able to regularly compile and test my code, it would have been a lot
harder to trust that the search-and-replace was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Also, the C preprocessor is kind of a weird thing to have in the language, but sometimes itâs really
neat that itâs there, when you need to do stuff like this.</p>
