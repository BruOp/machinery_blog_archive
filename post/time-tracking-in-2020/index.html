    <section class="text-break post-blog mx-auto">
      <p>As 2019 was wrapping up I found myself wanting to get some kind of high-level picture of what Iâve
spent the year doing. First, Iâm just curious. Second, I want to know how much time Iâve spent
building out different engine systems and if that time matches my initial estimates. Third, I want
to make sure that Iâve spent my time doing âthe rightâ things.</p>
<p>I think all good programmers have something of an obsessive nature and itâs sometimes easy to get
carried away with refactors and optimizations that in the big picture maybe donât matter that much.
With the small team we have at The Machinery, working on building a complete engine that outshines
the competition, we canât afford to mess around. Iâm usually pretty good at staying focused, but Iâm
always striving to improve.</p>
<p>I also want to get better at making time estimates. This is a notoriously difficult thing that we
programmers get asked to do all the time by our managers. Often we balk and try to squirm away:
âThatâs impossible! I canât possibly know how much time it takes before Iâve done it!â</p>
<p>Itâs easy to scoff at this attitude, but I actually think it is pretty reasonable. Estimating how
long it takes to code something is <em>hard</em> because programming is <em>fundamentally different</em> from most
other human endeavors. If you are building bridges, doing woodworking or cleaning the house, you
typically have a relatively short planning phase where you decide what to do and then a long
execution phase where you hunker down and do it. In the planning phase, you can make a reasonable
estimate of how long this execution phase is going to take.</p>
<p>However, programming, at least the way I see it, is pretty much <em>all planning</em>. The bulk of
programming is deciding <em>how</em> to solve something: what the APIs should be, how different components
should work together, etc. When you have decided exactly what do, writing out the code is trivial.
(For this reason, I also donât really like splitting coding into a planning and a coding phase. In
my view, <em>coding is planning</em>.) Since planning is the bulk of the work, estimating the size of a
coding task means trying to plan how long the planning is going to take. At that level of
meta-analysis, things become pretty sketchy. Many programmers donât want to give management numbers
theyâre not sure about, out of (an often valid) fear that management will take those numbers and run
with them.</p>
<p>But since Iâm an owner and a founder at Our Machinery, Iâm the one asking <em>myself</em> for these
estimates. And Iâm not willing to let me get away that easily!</p>
<p>As a planning instrument, time estimates are crucial. We want to know how much time something will
take to implement so that we can make an appropriate cost-benefit analysis. We also want to be able
to present some kind of road map of upcoming features, both for our own sake and the sake of our
customers. So we need to tackle the unpleasant task of making estimates.</p>
<p>The first step to getting better estimates is getting time tracking right. If weâre not even sure
how long something <em>did</em> take, how can we ever know how long something is <em>going</em> to take. With time
tracking as calibration, we can hopefully learn to improve our estimates, even if itâs always going
to be a difficult task. For example, Iâve noticed that I often overestimate the time it takes to
complete small tasks and underestimate the time it takes to complete big tasks. The reason, I think,
is that it always seems reasonable to say that something will take 1â2 days, even though many small
tasks can be completed in hours. Whereas for big tasks, it is just hard to think of <em>everything</em>
that goes into them. I end up missing stuff and underestimating.</p>
<p>One other thing I think is important is that you donât punish or reward employees for their
estimates. For example, you shouldnât force people to work overtime because they underestimated or
praise them because they overestimated and are âdone earlyâ. Neither should you shame them for
making estimates that are too long: âWhat, itâll take you three months to do this?â All of this will
just push your employees to make worse estimates.</p>
<p>Enough set about this tricky topic. In the rest of this post, Iâll focus on time tracking.</p>
<p>Looking back at 2019, I found it pretty hard to discern exactly where and how I had spent my time.
This even though I actually had three different and pretty detailed records of the work I had been
doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have a big todo-list in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210804193715/https://workflowy.com/referrals/">Workflowy</a>, where I keep track of
all the things on my plate. Workflowy sends me a summary email every day of tasks I have
completed. So this is a pretty detailed and complete record of everything Iâve been doing, except
it doesnât cover exactly how much time Iâve spent on each task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For time tracking I use <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210804193715/https://www.toggl.com/">toggl.com</a>. Whenever I switch to a new task I
start a Toggl timer. This way I can see both how much time Iâve spent on each individual task and
how many hours Iâve worked total. Each week, Toggl gives me a report which I summarize in a Slack
post to let the rest of the team know what Iâm working on. So this gives timing information, but
less detail, because I typically just make an entry called <em>Web Site</em> when Iâm working on the web
site without specifying exactly what I did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The git commit history contains a lot of information too. I subscribe to the âcommit early,
commit oftenâ philosophy, which means I usually commit changes multiple times a day. So the git
log can tell me what systems Iâve been working on (from the files I touched) and give an idea of
how much time Iâve spent on each (the time since the last commit). And, of course, the commit
comments themselves give more detailed information. But it doesnât tell me anything about
non-coding tasks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the problem is not a lack of data. Rather, the problem is <em>too much data</em>! Itâs hard to see the
forest for the trees! Going through these logs and trying to summarize them into high-level
information like âHow long did the physics system take to write?â would mean slogging through
thousands of entries.</p>
<p>I suppose I could sit down and sift through all of this, write some script to automatically analyze
the logs and the email archives and merge the information from all three sources to get a more
complete picture, but that would likely take days. And considering that the whole point of this was
to find out how to spend my time more efficiently that does not seem like a prudent thing to do.</p>
<p>So for 2020, Iâve decided that I need to do time tracking differently. If the goal is to have
high-level, big picture information available at-a-glance, then <em>that</em> is what I should be
collecting <em>all the time</em> â not try to piecemeal together at the end of the year.</p>
<p>I have three main things that I want to accomplish with time tracking.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, I want to know the total amount of hours I work each week. Since Iâm working from home
itâs easy to work both too little and too much. Too little, because thereâs always other stuff
that needs to be done around the house. Too much, because you can always pick up the laptop and
do some more work.</p>
<p>For me, I find the optimum to be about 30â40 hours of work per week. (Measured when Iâm actually
sitting down at my computer â hands on keyboard â so it doesnât include things like coffee breaks
or chit-chat with coworkers that would be a part of a normal office workday.) If I work &lt;30 hours
I get restless and frustrated and feel like Iâm not getting anything done. If I work</p>
<blockquote>
<p>40 hours I tend to get âbrain frazzleâ. I find it hard to relax, make poorer judgment calls
when coding and can easily get distracted by social media, blog posts, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I want to measure my total work hours to make sure that as far as possible I stay in this
30-40 hour sweet zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, I want to know how much of that time Iâm actually spending on the specific engine feature
Iâm primarily trying to implement. Sometimes I will counter-productively start to stress out
about how I âdidnât get anything done this weekâ, only to realize that the main reason is that
Iâve been occupied by other important tasks. Maybe I got derailed by a tricky bug that took two
days to fix. Maybe I needed to spend a lot of time planning out the roadmap, answering questions
on the forum or writing a blog post.</p>
<p>In addition to not feeling too bad, I also want to track this to make sure I keep a healthy
balance between feature work and all the other tasks that also need to be done. If this engine is
to be a success, I canât spend <em>all</em> my time fixing bugs, taking meetings, updating the web site
or answering forum questions. Iâd like to be able to spend at least 50 % of my time on feature
work, preferably more. If the time tracking shows me consistently dipping below that, I know that
I need to reconsider how Iâm spending my time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, as I said in the beginning, I want to know how long a feature took to implement so
that I can get better at estimating costs and planning. This information needs to be at a high
level and not bogged down with minutia. For example, I want to know how many weeks it took to
implement the physics system, not how many hours it took to add collision filtering to the
character controller. I also want this information to be available at-a-glance all the time and
not require batch processing of logs or something like that.</p>
<p>Having the information always available means I can <em>react</em> to it in real-time: âHuh, seems like
prettifying this part of the UI is taking a lot longer than I expected. Since this is not a
crucial task, it does not make sense to spend a week or more on it. I should switch to doing
something more important for our success.â</p>
<p>Side note: I use trunk-based development and avoid feature branches so that if I have to abort a
task early I will still have delivered value (in this case â prettified some parts of the UI).</p>
<p>Note that what Iâm interested in is the real, wall-clock time it took to implement the feature.
Not the time it would have taken in an ideal world where I could focus 100 % on feature work, was
never interrupted, didnât have any vacation days or sick kids, etc. Itâs the time in the real
world that matters, and there will always be things like this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these goals, hereâs the system Iâve come up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Iâll use Toggl to keep track of the time spent on each individual task Iâm working on (as before).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iâll assign each task to one of three categories (Toggl calls them <em>Projects</em>), so that Toggl can
tell me, not only how many hours Iâve worked each week, but also how much time Iâve spent on each
category:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature</strong> â Work on the primary feature Iâm currently adding to the engine (physics,
animation, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance</strong> â Fixing bugs, regressions, addressing user feedback, etc. Basically, any
coding work that is not a direct part of developing the feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Admin</strong> â Anything else I need to do for the company. Blogging, answering forum posts,
working on the website, emailing, distributing new alpha versions, raising money, planning,
etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each week, I send a note to my coworkers showing what percentage of my time has been spent on each
category, together with a short description of what Iâve done. Note that I only send percentage
numbers to my coworkers, not the actual hours worked. I record the hours worked each week for my
own sake and I want to avoid a culture where workers get shamed for low numbers or praised for
high numbers since that just tends to lead to the numbers getting fudged. âI read all these blog
posts vaguely related to work, so Iâll just record that as 5 worked hours.â I think things work
better when everybody is assumed to be a responsible adult until proven otherwise. Also, Iâd
rather encourage people to be efficient â to get more done in less time â than to work long hours.
Thereâs enough of <em>that</em> in this industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I record these numbers in a spreadsheet, together with one line describing the main feature that I
worked on that week. That way, itâs simple to get an overview of how many weeks a feature took by
looking at the spreadsheet. I donât really care about recording tasks with a more detailed
granularity than that. If I need more detailed information, I can always look at the logs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hereâs what the spreadsheet might look like:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Week #</strong></th>
<th><strong>Feature</strong></th>
<th><strong>Maintenance</strong></th>
<th><strong>Admin</strong></th>
<th><strong>Main Feature</strong></th>
<th><strong>Notes</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>18</td>
<td>12</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>Animation</td>
<td>Blend states</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>14</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>Animation</td>
<td>Locomotion</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Itâs not always 100 % clear how to draw the line between <em>Feature</em> and <em>Maintenance</em> work. For
example, while Iâm working on a feature I often discover that another system needs to be refactored
or has bugs. Typically I record that as <em>Feature</em> work. My reasoning behind this is that the
refactoring and API changes that need to be made are an integral part of the work on that feature
(without the feature, they wouldnât be needed â
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210804193715/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>). Also, discovering and fixing
minor bugs is just a natural part of coding.</p>
<p>The only exception is if I discover a particularly hairy bug in another system. Say a bug that takes
more than 1â2 hours to fix. In that case, I will record it as <em>Maintenance</em> work instead.</p>
<p>I aim to keep this time tracking system up for the rest of 2020 and see how it works.</p>
