Archived for posterity as a public service. Removed by request if it's a problem.
The pages have been stripped back to just the blog content as much as possible.
There may be missing images in the archive.

The blog was an invaluable resource to many and the strange circumstances of it's disappearance are a disservice to the work they've put into their engine and blog. It felt pertinent to make sure some or all of it was archived.
If for some reason the publicly available blog posts are no longer allowed to be stored publicly we'll oblige by removing them from here.
