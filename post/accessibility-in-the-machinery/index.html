    <section class="text-break post-blog mx-auto">
      <p>Tricia <a href=" ../../post/wasabi-part-3-accessibility/">wrote a blog post a while ago</a>
about how accessibility is really important for us here at Our Machinery and how we want to make
sure that The Machinery can be used by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So now is a good time to take stock of what accessibility features we have and what we plan to do in
the future.</p>
<!---more--->
<p>Note that in this post Iâm focusing on the accessibility of the <em>editor</em>, not on games built <em>in the
editor</em>. That is a slightly different (but related) topic.</p>
<h2 id="immediate-mode-guis-and-accessibility">Immediate Mode GUIs and Accessibility</h2>
<p>The Machinery uses an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI">Immediate Mode GUI</a> or
IMGUI. What this means is that instead of creating UI controls at startup and writing code that
keeps them synchronized with the application state, we just âdrawâ all the controls every frame,
using the current state.</p>
<p>The IMGUI toolkit we use is a custom toolkit that we ship as part of The Machinery. We do everything
ourselves, down to the drawing of the pixels that make up the buttons and checkboxes. We have a
number of good reasons for doing things this way instead of using an off-the-shelf UI toolkit, such
as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a>,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)">Qt</a>, or
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">Electron</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We get a consistent cross-platform look and behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Itâs easy to make whatever custom controls we need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have full control of the UIâs performance and can make use of GPU acceleration â ensuring that
the editor is just as fast as all the other parts of the engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We donât have to deal with any mysterious black boxes. We can follow a UI call all the way down to
the rendered pixels to figure out why it behaves the way it does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We donât have to worry about synchronizing the UI state and the application state, they are always
the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can iterate faster over the UI, which lets us do more in less time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to other UI solutions weâve worked with in the past, we vastly prefer this approach. But
using a custom IMGUI toolkit brings its own special challenges when it comes to accessibility. Since
we canât rely on the built-in accessibility features that come with OS or browser-based UI toolkits,
we have to build everything ourselves.</p>
<p>The flip side of that coin is that we have full control of the whole application stack and can more
easily experiment with novel solutions for accessibility.</p>
<p>Sometimes people have the misconception that IMGUIs canât be accessible. The argument is that if we
donât have a tree of pre-created UI objects, then there is nothing for a screen reader to query or
interact with.</p>
<p>I think this comes from a misunderstanding of what âimmediate modeâ means. At least to me,
âimmediate modeâ doesnât mean that we donât store or retain any information about the UI and the
controls that live there. Rather, itâs an API interaction style where instead of explicitly creating
and destroying objects and modifying their state, you just list the objects you want to have and the
state they should be in for each âtickâ of the application.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, an IMGUI might very well keep a full object tree around (as
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)">React</a> does with its <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)#Virtual_DOM">Virtual
DOM</a> approach). Or, it might
keep a smaller list of objects, just for accessibility purposes. This is in fact what we do, see the
<a href="index.html#screen-readers">Screen Readers</a> section below.</p>
<p>If youâre still not convinced about the suitability of IMGUIs for use in âreal applicationsâ,
another data point to consider is that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Docs">Google Docs</a>
recently announced that they are switching to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">canvas</a>-based instead of
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>-based rendering. Essentially, an
IMGUI-based approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html">Google Workspace Updates: Google Docs will now use canvas based rendering: this may impact some
Chrome
extensions</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google says that <em>âcompatibility for assistive technologies such as screen readers, braille devices
and screen magnification features, will not be impactedâ</em>.</p>
<h2 id="ui-zoom-and-high-contrast-color-schemes">UI Zoom and High-Contrast Color Schemes</h2>
<p>Our two main features for users with low vision are UI Zoom and high-contrast color schemes. Using
the <strong>Window &gt; Zoom</strong> menu, the editor UI can be zoomed to an arbitrary scale. You can zoom in for
better readability, or zoom out to fit more content on the screen:</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Using the Zoom menu option to make the UI bigger and smaller." src="../../images/access__zoom.gif"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Using the Zoom menu option to make the UI bigger and smaller.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The implementation of this in The Machinery is almost trivial. We already have a scale factor in the
UI to handle <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch#How_Microsoft_Windows_handles_DPI_scaling">DPI
settings</a> for
the display. All that was needed to implement the Zoom feature was to expose this scale factor to
the user.</p>
<p>In addition to this, The Machinery also works with the standard Magnifier tool in Windows, if you
prefer to use that.</p>
<p>The color scheme used by The Machinery is fully customizable (in both the free and the paid
versions). In addition to the default <em>Dark</em> and <em>Light</em> color themes, weâve recently added support
for high-contrast versions:</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="High-Contrast themes compared to regular themes." src="../../images/access__themes.gif"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>High-Contrast themes compared to regular themes.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>If you donât like our default colors, you can easily edit them using the <strong>Window &gt; Theme &gt; Edit
Themes..</strong> menu option. Let us know if you have any suggestions for changes to the high-contrast
themes that would improve legibility further.</p>
<h2 id="localization">Localization</h2>
<p>Localization is not usually thought of as an accessibility feature, but we think it falls under the
same umbrella. Providing localized versions of the UI makes the editor accessible to people who are
not English speakers.</p>
<p>Iâve already covered how localization is implemented in The Machinery, in the blog post
<a href=" ../../post/localization-in-the-machinerys-ui/">Localization in The Machineryâs
UI</a>, so in this post, I just
wanted to mention a few newly added features.</p>
<p>First, we have added a new rotating language option that makes the engine flip back and forth
between English and a target language. This lets you quickly compare the translated text with the
English original and see how the translation works in context. It also makes it easy to spot any
text that isnât being translated.</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Rotating between English and Swedish text." src="../../images/access__rotating.gif"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Rotating between English and Swedish text.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>In a similar vein, weâve added a hotkey that temporarily switches the UI back to English if it has
been set to a different language. Simply hold down <strong>F9</strong> and the UI will switch back to English.</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Temporarily switching the UI back to English by pressing F9." src="../../images/access__reveal.gif"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Temporarily switching the UI back to English by pressing F9.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>This serves two purposes. First, just as the rotating text mode, it can be used to debug and/or
verify the translations. Second, letâs be honest â translations are not always perfect. Even if a
user generally prefers to work in their native language, sometimes the translation can be confusing
and it can help to quickly peek at the original English. This is especially true for software that
contains a lot of technical jargon that can become hard to understand when translated.</p>
<p>We still have a fair amount of work to do on the localization system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We currently donât have support for right-to-left text such as Arabic and Urdu. We also donât
support shaping of cursive scripts such as Tamil and again Arabic. For more on these topics, see
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only language other than English that we currently support is Swedish. This doesnât make much
sense, because Swedish is not really a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_language">world
language</a>. But we needed some language other than
English in order to properly test the localization system and I happen to know Swedish, so there
we go.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in adding localization support for other languages, you can do so in a plugin.
We will add more âofficialâ languages based on user needs.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to try but havenât gotten around to yet is to add support for localization
through <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> or a similar translation service. Machine
translations canât compete with human ones, but for a user that doesnât know any English, itâs
better than nothing. And in combination with the F9 hotkey to ârevealâ the original text of any
particularly egregious translation, it could be workable.</p>
<h2 id="screen-readers">Screen Readers</h2>
<p>Weâve recently started working on adding support for screen readers. Since we want to support a wide
range of different screen readers across multiple platforms, weâve decided to abstract the support
into our own accessibility API. To add support for a specific screen reader, you can query UI
information out of the accessibility API and feed that into the screen readerâs API using some
lovely <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_code">glue code</a>.</p>
<p>The basis for the accessibility API is the <code>tm_ui_api-&gt;register_control()</code> function that informs the
API about a control in the UI:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">tm_ui_api<span style="color:#f92672">-&gt;</span>register_control(ui, TM_UI_ROLE__BUTTON, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Play&#34;</span>, rect);
</code></pre></div><p>This specifies that a control with the <code>BUTTON</code> role and the text <code>âPlayâ</code> exists at the specified
<code>rect</code> in the UI. If you use our built-in controls, such as <code>tm_ui_api-&gt;button()</code>, this function
will be called automatically for you. If you create your own controls out of raw draw calls, you are
responsible for making this call.</p>
<p>We save all the registered controls in an array and a screen reader can later query this array by
calling <code>automation_controls()</code> to get a list of all controls or <code>find_control()</code> to find a
particular control based on its role and title.</p>
<p>The <em>role</em> of the control tells the screen reader how to interact with it. The Machinery comes with
some predefined roles such as <code>BUTTON</code>, <code>CHECKBOX</code>, <code>STATIC_TEXT</code>, etc. but if you have a custom
control where none of these categories fit, you can define your own role.</p>
<p>To interact with a control, a screen reader calls the functions <code>mouse_move()</code>,
<code>mouse_button_state()</code> , <code>keyboard_key_state()</code>, and <code>text_input()</code> to provide virtual input to the
UI. For example, you can click on a control by moving the mouse there and then setting the button
state to <code>DOWN</code> followed by <code>UP</code>. You can drag an item by moving the mouse there, pressing <code>DOWN</code>,
moving to a new location, and then pressing <code>UP</code>.</p>
<p>Right now the state of this API is pretty rudimentary and there is a lot of information that is not
available, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>State of a control (enabled, disabled).</li>
<li>Value of a control (checked, unchecked, tristate, etc).</li>
<li>Selection, focus, caret position.</li>
<li>Hierarchical relationships: controls and sub-controls.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also havenât fed the information into an actual screen reader API yet. We need to do that to make
sure it works.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will probably extend the accessibility API with some sort of key-value table for
controls so that we can provide this extra information. But first, we need to learn more about what
kind of information would be valuable to our end-users and how they interact with the API.</p>
<p>If you are using game editors together with assistive technology, weâd be really interested in
getting your feedback so that we can make sure The Machinery works as well as possible.</p>
<p>Hereâs a screenshot of The Machinery with debug visualization for accessibility turned on. All the
controls that have been registered with the accessibility API are drawn with a red outline:</p>
<figure class="figure d-block">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded d-block" alt="Highlighting controls registered with the accessibility layer." src="../../images/access__highlight.png"/>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption fs-5">
        <h4>Highlighting controls registered with the accessibility layer.</h4>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
<h2 id="accessibility-for-everybody">Accessibility for Everybody</h2>
<p>Making software accessible can benefit more people than you might initially think. For example, I
often watch TV with captions on. English is my second language and my hearing is not perfect. Having
captions makes the dialogue a lot easier to understand, especially with some British accents
(mentioning no names). I also often watch videos with the sound off, because sound can be intrusive.
And sometimes I go straight to a transcript because I can scan it quicker than a video and search
for words Iâm interested in.</p>
<p>I think learning how to use <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceOver">VoiceOver</a> would be useful
too, so I can operate my phone while I need to look at other things, but I havenât gotten around to
it yet.</p>
<p>The accessibility features mentioned in this article are also generally useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Zoom is useful for users with varying screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Color themes make it easier to use the editor under various light conditions. And of course, itâs
also nice to be able to pick your own colors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The accessibility API acts as the foundation for UI automation. We use this in our integration and
regression tests to automatically drive the UI like a real user would, making sure that clicking
on buttons or selecting menu items has the expected result. In the future, we might use it to
implement a
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210819003813/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)#Keyboard_and_mouse_macros">macro</a> system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-we-missing">What are we missing?</h2>
<p>Weâre committed to making The Machinery the most accessible game engine out there and weâre always
trying to learn more about this space. If there is something we are missing or that we should tackle
differently, let us know!</p>
